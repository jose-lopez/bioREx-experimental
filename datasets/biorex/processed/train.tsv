[SEP] Hepatocyte nuclear factor-6: associations between genetic variability and type II diabetes and between genetic variability and estimates of insulin secretion. The transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-6 is an upstream regulator of several genes involved in the pathogenesis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young. We therefore tested the hypothesis that variability in the HNF-6 gene is associated with subsets of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and estimates of insulin secretion in glucose tolerant subjects.   We cloned the coding region as well as the intron-exon boundaries of the HNF-6 gene. We then examined them on genomic DNA in six @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ MODY @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ probands without mutations in the MODY1, @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ MODY3 @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ and MODY4 genes and in 54 patients with late-onset Type II diabetes by combined single strand conformational polymorphism-heteroduplex analysis followed by direct sequencing of identified variants. An identified missense variant was examined in association studies and genotype-phenotype studies.   We identified two silent and one missense (@GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ Pro75 Ala @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$) variant. In an association study the allelic frequency of the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ Pro75Ala @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ polymorphism was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.5) in 330 patients with Type II diabetes mellitus compared with 4.2% (2.4-6.0) in 238 age-matched glucose tolerant control subjects. Moreover, in studies of 238 middle-aged glucose tolerant subjects, of 226 glucose tolerant offspring of Type II diabetic patients and of 367 young healthy subjects, the carriers of the polymorphism did not differ from non-carriers in glucose induced serum insulin or C-peptide responses.   Mutations in the coding region of the HNF-6 gene are not associated with Type II diabetes or with changes in insulin responses to glucose among the Caucasians examined.		None

We therefore tested the hypothesis that variability in the @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ HNF-6 @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ gene is associated with subsets of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and estimates of insulin secretion in glucose tolerant subjects.   We cloned the coding region as well as the intron-exon boundaries of the @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ HNF-6 @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ gene. We then examined them on genomic DNA in six @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ MODY @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ probands without mutations in the MODY1, MODY3 and @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ MODY4 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ genes and in 54 patients with late-onset Type II diabetes by combined single strand conformational polymorphism-heteroduplex analysis followed by direct sequencing of identified variants. An identified missense variant was examined in association studies and genotype-phenotype studies.   We identified two silent and one missense (Pro75 Ala) variant. In an association study the allelic frequency of the Pro75Ala polymorphism was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.5) in 330 patients with Type II diabetes mellitus compared with 4.2% (2.4-6.0) in 238 age-matched glucose tolerant control subjects. Moreover, in studies of 238 middle-aged glucose tolerant subjects, of 226 glucose tolerant offspring of Type II diabetic patients and of 367 young healthy subjects, the carriers of the polymorphism did not differ from non-carriers in glucose induced serum insulin or C-peptide responses.   Mutations in the coding region of the @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ HNF-6 @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ gene are not associated with Type II diabetes or with changes in insulin responses to glucose among the Caucasians examined.

We cloned the coding region as well as the intron-exon boundaries of the HNF-6 gene. We then examined them on genomic DNA in six @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ MODY @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ probands without mutations in the MODY1, @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ MODY3 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ and @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ MODY4 @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ genes and in 54 patients with late-onset Type II diabetes by combined single strand conformational polymorphism-heteroduplex analysis followed by direct sequencing of identified variants. An identified missense variant was examined in association studies and genotype-phenotype studies.   We identified two silent and one missense (Pro75 Ala) variant. In an association study the allelic frequency of the Pro75Ala polymorphism was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.5) in 330 patients with Type II diabetes mellitus compared with 4.2% (2.4-6.0) in 238 age-matched glucose tolerant control subjects. Moreover, in studies of 238 middle-aged glucose tolerant subjects, of 226 glucose tolerant offspring of Type II diabetic patients and of 367 young healthy subjects, the carriers of the polymorphism did not differ from non-carriers in glucose induced serum insulin or C-peptide responses.   Mutations in the coding region of the HNF-6 gene are not associated with Type II diabetes or with changes in insulin responses to glucose among the Caucasians examined.		None

[SEP] @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ Langerin @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$, a novel @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ C-type lectin @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ specific to Langerhans cells, is an endocytic receptor that induces the formation of Birbeck granules. We have identified a @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ type II Ca2+-dependent lectin @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ displaying @ChemicalEntitySrc$ mannose @ChemicalEntitySrc/$-binding specificity, exclusively expressed by Langerhans cells (LC), and named @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ Langerin @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$. LC are uniquely characterized by Birbeck granules (BG), which are organelles consisting of superimposed and zippered membranes. Here, we have shown that @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ Langerin @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ is constitutively associated with BG and that antibody to @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ Langerin @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ is internalized into these structures. Remarkably, transfection of @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ Langerin @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ cDNA into fibroblasts created a compact network of membrane structures with typical features of BG. @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ Langerin @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ is thus a potent inducer of membrane superimposition and zippering leading to BG formation. Our data suggest that induction of BG is a consequence of the antigen-capture function of @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ Langerin @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$, allowing routing into these organelles and providing access to a nonclassical antigen-processing pathway.

While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ Parkinson's disease @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study. A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off-periods even in patients with complex on-off motor swings. Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off-time by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add-on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or COMT inhibitors. Extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of apomorphine efficacy. In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role. Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ Parkinson's disease @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use.

BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and @ChemicalEntitySrc$ tacrolimus @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ are both known to be nephrotoxic.

METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ or @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$, n=748; @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$, sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$, n=45.

RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (@DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ 8.6% and @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ 9.5%). Compared with control patients, @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ and @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ or @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group.

CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ and @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ at a high rate.

Patients who develop @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ or @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$.

METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834).

Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ therapy, and survival from onset of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$. RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (@DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ 8.6% and @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ 9.5%).

This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ and @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ chronic renal failure @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ (@DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$) in OLTX patients. METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ or @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$, n=748; @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$, sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$, n=45. Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ therapy, and survival from onset of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$. RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (@DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ 8.6% and @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ 9.5%). Compared with control patients, @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ and @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ or @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group. Patients developing @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ had a 6-year survival after onset of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ who subsequently received kidney transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ and @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ at a high rate. The development of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only. Patients who develop @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ CRF @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ or @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ ESRD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$. New strategies for long-term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication.		None

In addition, the previously described variants g.3352delG (commonly designated 30delG or 35 delG), g.3426G>A [p.Val37Ile], g.3697G>A [p.Arg127His], @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ g.3774G>A @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ [@GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ p.Val153Ile @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$], and g.3795G>A [p.Gly160Ser] were identified. With the exception of g.3318-34C>T and g.3352delG, all variants occurred heterozygously. For most of the variants identified in the Kenyan and Sudanese study population, a causative association with @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ NSARD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ appears to be unlikely. Compared to many other ethnic groups, deafness-associated variants of the coding region of GJB2 are rare in Sudan and Kenya, suggesting a role of other genetic, or epigenetic factors as a cause for deafness in these countries.
