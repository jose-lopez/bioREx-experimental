AIMed_d21_1|t|Regulated trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters: common notes but different melodies.

AIMed_d21_2|t|The activity of biogenic amine and amino acid neurotransmitters is limited by presynaptic and astrocytic Na(+)-dependent transport systems.

AIMed_d21_3|t|Their functional importance is underscored by the observation that these transporters are the targets of broad classes of psychotherapeutic agents, including antidepressants and stimulants.

AIMed_d21_4|t|Early studies suggested that the activity of these transporters can be fine tuned by a number of different signaling pathways.

AIMed_d21_5|t|In the past five years, several groups have provided compelling evidence that changing the cell surface availability of these transporters contributes to this fine tuning.

AIMed_d21_6|t|This regulated trafficking can result in rapid (within minutes) increases or decreases in the plasma membrane expression of these transporters and is independent of transcriptional or translational control mechanisms.

AIMed_d21_7|t|Many of the same signaling molecules, including protein kinase C (PKC), tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13-K), and protein phosphatase, regulate the transporters for different neurotransmitters.

AIMed_d21_8|t|In addition to these classical receptor activated pathways, transporter substrates also regulate activity and cell surface expression of these transporters.

AIMed_d21_9|t|In fact, some of the transporters form complexes with signaling molecules.

AIMed_d21_10|t|Given the functional and genetic similarities of these transporters, it is not surprising that the same signaling molecules regulate their trafficking, but except for the molecules, the actual effects on individual transporters are remarkably different.

AIMed_d177_2|t|Many biological processes rely upon protein-protein interactions.

AIMed_d177_3|t|Hence, detailed analysis of these interactions is critical for their understanding.

AIMed_d177_4|t|Due to the complexities involved, genetic approaches are often needed.

AIMed_d177_5|t|In yeast and phage, genetic characterizations of protein complexes are possible.

AIMed_d177_6|t|However, in multicellular organisms, such characterizations are limited by the lack of powerful selection systems.

AIMed_d177_7|t|Herein we describe genetic selections that allow single amino acid changes that disrupt protein-protein interactions to be selected from large libraries of randomly generated mutant alleles.

AIMed_d177_8|t|The strategy, based on a yeast reverse two-hybrid system, involves a first-step negative selection for mutations that affect interaction, followed by a second-step positive selection for a subset of these mutations that maintain expression of full-length protein (two-step selection).

AIMed_d177_9|t|We have selected such mutations in the transcription factor E2F1 that affect its ability to heterodimerize with DP1.

AIMed_d212_3|t|Previous results have demonstrated that AT cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are defective at the G1/S checkpoint after radiation damage.

AIMed_d212_4|t|Because cells lacking the protein tyrosine kinase c-Abl are also defective in radiation-induced G1 arrest, we investigated the possibility that ATM might interact with c-Abl in response to radiation damage.

AIMed_d43_2|t|Neurotrophins are important for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system, mediating their signal into the cell by specific interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors of the Trk family.

AIMed_d43_3|t|The extracellular portion of the Trk receptors has been previously proposed to consist of a cysteine-rich motif, a leucine-rich motif, a second cysteine-rich motif followed by two immunoglobulin-like domains.

AIMed_d43_4|t|Earlier studies have shown that a major neurotrophin-binding site in the Trk receptors resides in the second immunoglobulin-like domain.

AIMed_d43_5|t|Although the individual amino acids in TrkA involved in binding to nerve growth factor (NGF) and those in TrkC involved in binding to neurotrophin-3 have been mapped in this domain, the Trk amino acids that provide specificity remained unclear.

AIMed_d15_7|t|RESULTS: The cytokines analyzed were detectable in the seminal plasma of patients with chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls.

AIMed_d162_1	96	99	p53	Gene	T1

AIMed_d162_2|t|Thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent transcriptional factors that regulate growth, differentiation, and development.

AIMed_d162_3|t|The molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate these effects are unclear.

AIMed_d162_4|t|One prevailing hypothesis suggests that TRs may cooperate with other transcriptional factors to mediate their biological effects.

AIMed_d162_5|t|In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the activity of TRs is modulated by the tumor suppressor p53.

AIMed_d208_1|t|Early events in TNF signaling: a story of associations and dissociations.

AIMed_d208_2|t|At the cellular level, the multifunctional cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) modulates growth and activates genes through various intermediates, including protein kinases, protein phosphatases, reactive oxygen intermediates, phospholipases, proteases, sphingomyelinases, and transcription factors.

AIMed_d208_3|t|Unlike many cytokine receptors, however, the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the TNF receptors lacks an intrinsic protein kinase activity and yet on interaction with ligand it phosphorylates various proteins.

AIMed_d208_4|t|Although the kinetics of most of these activities differ, their interactions are coordinated through the selective interplay between the CD of the receptors and the associated proteins.

AIMed_d208_5|t|A unique pathway has been identified by the ability of the TNF receptors to associate with a novel family of proteins.

AIMed_d208_6|t|Two distinct families of proteins have emerged, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and the death domain homologues.

AIMed_d208_7|t|The cloning of members of these gene families and the identification of the protein-interaction motifs found within their gene products has initiated the molecular identity of factors (TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs) associated with both of the p60 and p80 forms of the TNF receptor and with other members of the TNF receptor superfamily.

AIMed_d109_4|t|Both subunits form continuous alpha-helices.

AIMed_d109_5|t|The carboxy-terminal regions form an asymmetric coiled-coil, and the amino-terminal regions make base-specific contacts with DNA in the major groove.

AIMed_d109_6|t|Comparison of the two crystallographically distinct protein-DNA complexes show that the coiled-coil is flexibly joined to the basic regions and that the Fos-Jun heterodimer does not recognize the asymmetric 5'-TGAGTCA-3' recognition element in a unique orientation.

AIMed_d109_7|t|There is an extensive network of electrostatic interactions between subunits within the coiled-coil, consistent with proposals that these interactions determine preferential formation of the heterodimer over either of the homodimers.

AIMed_d219_2|t|Although Raf-1 is a critical effector of Ras signaling and transformation, the mechanism by which Ras promotes Raf-1 activation is complex and remains poorly understood.

AIMed_d219_3|t|We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain</T10> (Raf-CRD, residues 139-184) may be required for Raf-1 activation.

AIMed_d219_4	73	78	Raf-1	Gene	T14

AIMed_d219_5|t|Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins.

AIMed_d219_6|t|However, whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined.

AIMed_d219_8|t|Moreover, mutation of Raf-1 residues 143-145 impairs binding of 14-3-3, but not Ras, to the Raf-CRD.

AIMed_d219_10|t|Thus, 14-3-3 interaction with the Raf-CRD may serve in negative regulation of Raf-1 function by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3 from the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 to promote subsequent events necessary for full activation of Raf-1.
