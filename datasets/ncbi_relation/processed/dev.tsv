[SEP] Congenital hypothyroidism due to a new deletion in the @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ sodium/iodide symporter @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ protein. OBJECTIVE: Iodide transport defect (ITD) is a rare disorder characterised by an inability of the thyroid to maintain an iodide gradient across the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells, that often results in congenital hypothyroidism. When present the defect is also found in the salivary glands and gastric mucosa and it has been shown to arise from abnormalities of the @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ sodium/iodide symporter @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ (@GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ NIS @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$). PATIENT: We describe a woman with hypothyroidism identified at the 3rd month of life. The diagnosis of ITD was suspected because of nodular goitre, and little if any iodide uptake by the thyroid and salivary glands. Treatment with iodide partially corrected the hypothyroidism; however, long-term substitution therapy with L-thyroxine was started. MEASUREMENTS: Thyroid radioiodide uptake was only 1.4% and 0.3% at 1 and 24 h after the administration of recombinant human TSH. The saliva to plasma I- ratio was 1.1 indicating that the inability of the thyroid gland to concentrate I- was also present in the salivary glands. RESULTS: Analysis of the patient's @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ NIS @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ gene revealed a 15 nucleotide (nt) @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ deletion of the coding sequence (nt 1314 through nt 1328) @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ and the insertion of 15 nt duplicating the first 15 nt of the adjacent intron. The patient was homozygous for this insertion/deletion, while both consanguineous parents were heterozygous. This deletion predicts the production of a protein lacking the five terminal amino acids of exon XI (439-443) which are located in the 6th intracellular loop. COS-7 cells transfected with a vector expressing the mutant del-(439-443) @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ NIS @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ failed to concentrate iodide, suggesting that the mutation was the direct cause of the ITD in this patient. CONCLUSION: In conclusion we describe the first Italian case of congenital hypothyroidism due to a new deletion in the @GeneOrGeneProductSrc$ NIS @GeneOrGeneProductSrc/$ gene.		None

OBJECTIVE: @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ Iodide transport defect @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ (@DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ ITD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$) is a rare disorder characterised by an inability of the thyroid to maintain an iodide gradient across the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells, that often results in congenital hypothyroidism. When present the defect is also found in the salivary glands and gastric mucosa and it has been shown to arise from abnormalities of the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS). PATIENT: We describe a woman with hypothyroidism identified at the 3rd month of life. The diagnosis of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ ITD @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ was suspected because of nodular goitre, and little if any iodide uptake by the thyroid and salivary glands. Treatment with iodide partially corrected the hypothyroidism; however, long-term substitution therapy with L-thyroxine was started. MEASUREMENTS: Thyroid radioiodide uptake was only 1.4% and 0.3% at 1 and 24 h after the administration of recombinant human TSH. The saliva to plasma I- ratio was 1.1 indicating that the inability of the thyroid gland to concentrate I- was also present in the salivary glands. RESULTS: Analysis of the patient's NIS gene revealed a 15 nucleotide (nt) deletion of the coding sequence (nt 1314 through nt 1328) and the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ insertion of 15 nt duplicating the first 15 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ nt of the adjacent intron. The patient was homozygous for this insertion/deletion, while both consanguineous parents were heterozygous.

OBJECTIVE: Iodide transport defect (ITD) is a rare disorder characterised by an inability of the thyroid to maintain an @ChemicalEntitySrc$ iodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ gradient across the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells, that often results in congenital hypothyroidism. When present the defect is also found in the salivary glands and gastric mucosa and it has been shown to arise from abnormalities of the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS). PATIENT: We describe a woman with hypothyroidism identified at the 3rd month of life. The diagnosis of ITD was suspected because of nodular goitre, and little if any @ChemicalEntitySrc$ iodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ uptake by the thyroid and salivary glands. Treatment with @ChemicalEntitySrc$ iodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ partially corrected the hypothyroidism; however, long-term substitution therapy with L-thyroxine was started. MEASUREMENTS: Thyroid @ChemicalEntitySrc$ radioiodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ uptake was only 1.4% and 0.3% at 1 and 24 h after the administration of recombinant human TSH. The saliva to plasma @ChemicalEntitySrc$ I- @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ ratio was 1.1 indicating that the inability of the thyroid gland to concentrate @ChemicalEntitySrc$ I- @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ was also present in the salivary glands. RESULTS: Analysis of the patient's NIS gene revealed a 15 nucleotide (nt) deletion of the coding sequence (nt 1314 through nt 1328) and the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ insertion of 15 nt duplicating the first 15 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ nt of the adjacent intron. The patient was homozygous for this insertion/deletion, while both consanguineous parents were heterozygous. This deletion predicts the production of a protein lacking the five terminal amino acids of exon XI (439-443) which are located in the 6th intracellular loop. COS-7 cells transfected with a vector expressing the mutant del-(439-443) NIS failed to concentrate @ChemicalEntitySrc$ iodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$, suggesting that the mutation was the direct cause of the ITD in this patient. CONCLUSION: In conclusion we describe the first Italian case of congenital hypothyroidism due to a new deletion in the NIS gene.		None

The diagnosis of ITD was suspected because of nodular goitre, and little if any @ChemicalEntitySrc$ iodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ uptake by the thyroid and salivary glands. Treatment with @ChemicalEntitySrc$ iodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ partially corrected the hypothyroidism; however, long-term substitution therapy with L-thyroxine was started. MEASUREMENTS: Thyroid @ChemicalEntitySrc$ radioiodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ uptake was only 1.4% and 0.3% at 1 and 24 h after the administration of recombinant human TSH. The saliva to plasma @ChemicalEntitySrc$ I- @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ ratio was 1.1 indicating that the inability of the thyroid gland to concentrate @ChemicalEntitySrc$ I- @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ was also present in the salivary glands. RESULTS: Analysis of the patient's NIS gene revealed a 15 nucleotide (nt) deletion of the coding sequence (nt 1314 through nt 1328) and the insertion of 15 nt duplicating the first 15 nt of the adjacent intron. The patient was homozygous for this insertion/deletion, while both consanguineous parents were heterozygous. This deletion predicts the production of a protein lacking the five terminal amino acids of exon XI (439-443) which are located in the 6th intracellular loop. COS-7 cells transfected with a vector expressing the mutant del-(439-443) NIS failed to concentrate @ChemicalEntitySrc$ iodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$, suggesting that the mutation was the direct cause of the ITD in this patient. CONCLUSION: In conclusion we describe the first Italian case of congenital hypothyroidism due to a new deletion in the NIS gene.		Association

The diagnosis of ITD was suspected because of nodular goitre, and little if any @ChemicalEntitySrc$ iodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ uptake by the thyroid and salivary glands. Treatment with @ChemicalEntitySrc$ iodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ partially corrected the hypothyroidism; however, long-term substitution therapy with @ChemicalEntityTgt$ L-thyroxine @ChemicalEntityTgt/$ was started. MEASUREMENTS: Thyroid @ChemicalEntitySrc$ radioiodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ uptake was only 1.4% and 0.3% at 1 and 24 h after the administration of recombinant human TSH. The saliva to plasma @ChemicalEntitySrc$ I- @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ ratio was 1.1 indicating that the inability of the thyroid gland to concentrate @ChemicalEntitySrc$ I- @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ was also present in the salivary glands. RESULTS: Analysis of the patient's NIS gene revealed a 15 nucleotide (nt) deletion of the coding sequence (nt 1314 through nt 1328) and the insertion of 15 nt duplicating the first 15 nt of the adjacent intron. The patient was homozygous for this insertion/deletion, while both consanguineous parents were heterozygous. This deletion predicts the production of a protein lacking the five terminal amino acids of exon XI (439-443) which are located in the 6th intracellular loop. COS-7 cells transfected with a vector expressing the mutant del-(439-443) NIS failed to concentrate @ChemicalEntitySrc$ iodide @ChemicalEntitySrc/$, suggesting that the mutation was the direct cause of the ITD in this patient. CONCLUSION: In conclusion we describe the first Italian case of congenital hypothyroidism due to a new deletion in the NIS gene.		None

In an attempt to asses the contribution of both mutations to the development of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ sporadic lymphoid malignancies @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$, we analyzed DNA samples from a large group of Polish pediatric patients. The NBS1 mutation 657del5 on one allele was found in 3 of 270 patients with ALL and 2 of 212 children and adolescents with NHL; no carrier was found among 63 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). No carriers of the variant @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ R215W @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ were detected in any studied group. The relative frequency of the 657del5 mutation was calculated from a total of 6,984 controls matched by place of patient residence, of whom 42 were found to be carriers (frequency = 0.006). In the analyzed population with malignancies, an increased odds ratio for the occurrence of mutation 657del5 was found in comparison with the control Polish population (OR range 1.48-1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.65). This finding indicates that the frequency of the mutation carriers was indeed increased in patients with ALL and NHL (p < 0.05).

In addition, the substitution 643C>T (R215W) has also been found in excess among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In an attempt to asses the contribution of both mutations to the development of sporadic lymphoid malignancies, we analyzed DNA samples from a large group of Polish pediatric patients. The NBS1 mutation @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ 657del5 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ on one allele was found in 3 of 270 patients with ALL and 2 of 212 children and adolescents with NHL; no carrier was found among 63 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). No carriers of the variant R215W were detected in any studied group. The relative frequency of the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ 657del5 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ mutation was calculated from a total of 6,984 controls matched by place of patient residence, of whom 42 were found to be carriers (frequency = 0.006). In the analyzed population with malignancies, an increased odds ratio for the occurrence of mutation @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ 657del5 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ was found in comparison with the control Polish population (OR range 1.48-1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.65). This finding indicates that the frequency of the mutation carriers was indeed increased in patients with ALL and NHL (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, NBS1 gene heterozygosity is not a major risk factor for lymphoid malignancies in childhood and adolescence.		None

We originally described a methionine-->valine substitution at codon 404 (M404V) of exon 8, in the ubiquitin protein-binding domain of p62/SQSTM1 gene in an Italian @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ PDB @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ patient. The collection of data from the patient's pedigree provided evidence for a familial form of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ PDB @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$. Extension of the genetic analysis to other relatives in this family demonstrated segregation of the M404V mutation with the polyostotic @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ PDB @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ phenotype and provided the identification of six asymptomatic gene carriers. DNA for mutational analysis of the exon 8 coding sequence was obtained from 22 subjects, 4 @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ PDB @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ patients and 18 clinically unaffected members. Of the five clinically ascertained affected members of the family, four possessed the M404V mutation and exhibited the polyostotic form of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ PDB @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$, except one patient with a single X-ray-assessed skeletal localization and one with a polyostotic disease who had died several years before the DNA analysis. By both reconstitution and mutational analysis of the pedigree, six unaffected subjects were shown to bear the M404V mutation, representing potential asymptomatic gene carriers whose circulating levels of @ChemicalEntitySrc$ alkaline phosphatase @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ were recently assessed as still within the normal range. Taken together, these results support a genotype-phenotype correlation between the M404V mutation in the p62/SQSTM1 gene and a polyostotic form of @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ PDB @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ in this family. The high penetrance of the @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ PDB @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$ trait in this family together with the study of the asymptomatic gene carriers will allow us to confirm the proposed genotype-phenotype correlation and to evaluate the potential use of mutational analysis of the p62/SQSTM1 gene in the early detection of relatives at risk for @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt$ PDB @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureTgt/$.

Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ DRD2 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ DRD2 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ plays in chlorpromazine-induced @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ EPS @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ DRD2 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ EPS @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ and 87 without @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ EPS @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks. The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ DRD2 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.

[SEP] Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and @ChemicalEntitySrc$ chlorpromazine @ChemicalEntitySrc/$-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients. AIM: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor. Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in @ChemicalEntitySrc$ chlorpromazine @ChemicalEntitySrc/$-induced EPS in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ rs6277 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with @ChemicalEntitySrc$ chlorpromazine @ChemicalEntitySrc/$ after 8 weeks. The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ rs6277 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by @ChemicalEntitySrc$ chlorpromazine @ChemicalEntitySrc/$, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.

[SEP] Skewed X inactivation in an X linked nystagmus family resulted from a novel, p.R229G, missense mutation in the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ FRMD7 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene. AIMS: This study aimed to identify the underlying @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ genetic defect @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ of a large Turkish X linked nystagmus (NYS) family. METHODS: Both Xp11 and Xq26 loci were tested by linkage analysis. The 12 exons and intron-exon junctions of the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ FRMD7 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene were screened by direct sequencing. X chromosome inactivation analysis was performed by enzymatic predigestion of DNA with a methylation-sensitive enzyme, followed by PCR of the polymorphic CAG repeat of the androgen receptor gene. RESULTS: The family contained 162 individuals, among whom 28 had NYS. Linkage analysis confirmed the Xq26 locus. A novel missense c.686C>G mutation, which causes the substitution of a conserved arginine at amino acid position 229 by glycine (p.R229G) in exon 8 of the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ FRMD7 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene, was observed. This change was not documented in 120 control individuals. The clinical findings in a female who was homozygous for the mutation were not different from those of affected heterozygous females. Skewed X inactivation was remarkable in the affected females of the family. CONCLUSIONS: A novel p.R229G mutation in the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ FRMD7 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene causes the NYS phenotype, and skewed X inactivation influences the manifestation of the disease in X linked NYS females.

AIMS: This study aimed to identify the underlying genetic defect of a large Turkish X linked nystagmus (NYS) family. METHODS: Both Xp11 and Xq26 loci were tested by linkage analysis. The 12 exons and intron-exon junctions of the FRMD7 gene were screened by direct sequencing. X chromosome inactivation analysis was performed by enzymatic predigestion of DNA with a methylation-sensitive enzyme, followed by PCR of the polymorphic @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ CAG repeat @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ of the androgen receptor gene. RESULTS: The family contained 162 individuals, among whom 28 had NYS. Linkage analysis confirmed the Xq26 locus.

[SEP] Identification of apolipoprotein E Guangzhou (@GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ arginine 150 proline @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$), a new variant associated with lipoprotein glomerulopathy. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare disease characterized by thrombus-like substances in markedly dilated glomerular capillaries and elevated plasma levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE). Previous studies have shown that genetic disorders of apoE may contribute to the pathogenesis of LPG, but LPG may not be caused by apoE gene mutations in Chinese patients. This study investigated the association of a new variant of apoE with LPG in a Chinese family. METHODS: The apoE gene in a family with 4 LPG patients was sequenced. The polymerase chain reaction product of coding region of apoE exon 4 was cloned into pMD 18-T vector and then sequenced. RESULTS: A novel point mutation in exon 4 of the apoE gene was identified in all 4 LPG patients and 1 asymptomatic family member. Sequence analysis confirmed a nucleotide G to C point mutation in exon 4 (base 308) of the apoE gene in all patients and the asymptomatic family member. This missense mutation denotes amino acid substitution of the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ proline residue for arginine residue at position 150 @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ of apoE. Those patients were all heterozygotes with apoE Guangzhou. One of 2 grandsons was a heterozygous carrier of apoE Guangzhou, although he did not have @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ proteinuria @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that apoE (@GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ arginine 150 proline @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$) is a novel apoE variant that etiologically related to LPG. This variant (apoE Guangzhou) may cause a marked molecular conformational change of the apoE and thus impair its binding ability to lipids.		None

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare disease characterized by thrombus-like substances in markedly @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc$ dilated glomerular capillaries @DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureSrc/$ and elevated plasma levels of @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apolipoprotein E @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ (@GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$). Previous studies have shown that genetic disorders of @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ may contribute to the pathogenesis of LPG, but LPG may not be caused by @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene mutations in Chinese patients. This study investigated the association of a new variant of @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ with LPG in a Chinese family. METHODS: The @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene in a family with 4 LPG patients was sequenced. The polymerase chain reaction product of coding region of @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ exon 4 was cloned into pMD 18-T vector and then sequenced. RESULTS: A novel point mutation in exon 4 of the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene was identified in all 4 LPG patients and 1 asymptomatic family member. Sequence analysis confirmed a nucleotide G to C point mutation in exon 4 (base 308) of the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ gene in all patients and the asymptomatic family member. This missense mutation denotes amino acid substitution of the proline residue for arginine residue at position 150 of @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$. Those patients were all heterozygotes with @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ Guangzhou. One of 2 grandsons was a heterozygous carrier of @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ Guangzhou, although he did not have proteinuria. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ (arginine 150 proline) is a novel @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ variant that etiologically related to LPG. This variant (@GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ Guangzhou) may cause a marked molecular conformational change of the @GeneOrGeneProductTgt$ apoE @GeneOrGeneProductTgt/$ and thus impair its binding ability to lipids.
