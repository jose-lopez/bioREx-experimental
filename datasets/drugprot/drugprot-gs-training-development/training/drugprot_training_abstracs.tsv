17512723	RDH12, a retinol dehydrogenase causing Leber's congenital amaurosis, is also involved in steroid metabolism.	Three retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) were tested for steroid converting abilities: human and murine RDH 12 and human RDH13. RDH12 is involved in retinal degeneration in Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). We show that murine Rdh12 and human RDH13 do not reveal activity towards the checked steroids, but that human type 12 RDH reduces dihydrotestosterone to androstanediol, and is thus also involved in steroid metabolism. Furthermore, we analyzed both expression and subcellular localization of these enzymes.
23557993	A diarylheptanoid phytoestrogen from Curcuma comosa, 1,7-diphenyl-4,6-heptadien-3-ol, accelerates human osteoblast proliferation and differentiation.	Curcuma comosa Roxb. is ginger-family plant used to relieve menopausal symptoms. Previous work showed that C. comosa extracts protect mice from ovariectomy-induced osteopenia with minimal effects on reproductive organs, and identified the diarylheptanoid (3R)-1,7-diphenyl-(4E,6E)-4,6-heptadien-3-ol (DPHD) as the major active component of C. comosa rhizomes. At 1-10μM, DPHD increased differentiation in transformed mouse osteoblasts, but the effect of DPHD on normal bone cells was unknown. We examined the concentration dependency and mechanism of action of DPHD relative to 17β-estradiol in nontransformed human osteoblasts (h-OB). The h-OB were 10-100 fold more sensitive to DPHD than transformed osteoblasts: DPHD increased h-OB proliferation at 10nM and, at 100nM, activated MAP kinase signaling within 30min. In long-term differentiation assays, responses of h-OB to DPHD were significant at 10nM, and optimal response in most cases was at 100nM. At 7-21 days, DPHD accelerated osteoblast differentiation, indicated by alkaline phosphatase activity and osteoblast-specific mRNA production. Effects of DPHD were eliminated by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI182780. During differentiation, DPHD promoted early expression of osteoblast transcription factors, RUNX2 and osterix. Subsequently, DPHD accelerated production of bone structural genes, including COL1A1 and osteocalcin comparably to 17β-estradiol. In h-OB, DPHD increased the osteoprotegerin to RANKL ratio and supported mineralization more efficiently than 10nM 17β-estradiol. We conclude that DPHD promotes human osteoblast function in vitro effectively at nanomolar concentrations, making it a promising compound to protect bone in menopausal women.
23161873	The role of the carbohydrate response element-binding protein in male fructose-fed rats.	By 2030, nearly half of Americans will have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In part, this epidemic is fueled by the increasing consumption of caloric sweeteners coupled with an innate capacity to convert sugar into fat via hepatic de novo lipogenesis. In addition to serving as substrates, monosaccharides also increase the expression of key enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis via the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP). To determine whether ChREBP is a potential therapeutic target, we decreased hepatic expression of ChREBP with a specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed either a high-fructose or high-fat diet. ChREBP ASO treatment decreased plasma triglyceride concentrations compared with control ASO treatment in both diet groups. The reduction was more pronounced in the fructose-fed group and attributed to decreased hepatic expression of ACC2, FAS, SCD1, and MTTP and a decrease in the rate of hepatic triglyceride secretion. This was associated with an increase in insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose uptake, as assessed by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. In contrast, ChREBP ASO did not alter hepatic lipid content or hepatic insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, fructose-fed rats treated with ChREBP ASO had increased plasma uric acid, alanine transaminase, and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations. This was associated with decreased expression of fructose aldolase and fructokinase, reminiscent of inherited disorders of fructose metabolism. In summary, these studies suggest that targeting ChREBP may prevent fructose-induced hypertriglyceridemia but without the improvements in hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin responsiveness.
17292977	Biological activity of AC3174, a peptide analog of exendin-4.	Exenatide, the active ingredient of BYETTA (exenatide injection), is an incretin mimetic that has been developed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Exenatide binds to and activates the known GLP-1 receptor with a potency comparable to that of the mammalian incretin GLP-1(7-36), thereby acting as a glucoregulatory agent. AC3174 is an analog of exenatide with leucine substituted for methionine at position 14, [Leu(14)]exendin-4. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the glucoregulatory activity and pharmacokinetics of AC3174. In RINm5f cell membranes, the potency of AC3174 for the displacement of [(125)I]GLP-1 and activation of adenylate cyclase was similar to that of exenatide and GLP-1. In vivo, AC3174, administered as a single IP injection, significantly decreased plasma glucose concentration and glucose excursion following the administration of an oral glucose challenge in both non-diabetic (C57BL/6) and diabetic db/db mice (P<0.05 vs. vehicle-treated). The magnitude of glucose lowering of AC3174 was comparable to exenatide. The ED(50) values of AC3174 for glucose lowering (60 minute post-dose) were 1.2 microg/kg in db/db mice and 1.3 microg/kg in C57BL/6 mice. AC3174 has insulinotropic activity in vivo. Administration of AC3174 resulted in a 4-fold increase in insulin concentrations in normal mice following an IP glucose challenge. AC3174 was also shown to inhibit food intake and decrease gastric emptying in rodent models. AC3174 was stable in human plasma (>90% of parent peptide was present after 5 h of incubation). In rats, the in vivo half-life of AC3174 was 42-43 min following SC administration. In summary, AC3174 is an analog of exenatide that binds to the GLP-1 receptor in vitro and shares many of the biological and glucoregulatory activities of exenatide and GLP-1 in vivo.
23348500	A novel metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 positive allosteric modulator acts at a unique site and confers stimulus bias to mGlu5 signaling.	Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) is a target for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, mGlu5 has been shown to play an important role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically in long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP), which is thought to be involved in cognition. Multiple mGlu5-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have been developed from a variety of different scaffolds. Previous work has extensively characterized a common allosteric site on mGlu5, termed the MPEP (2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine) binding site. However, one mGlu5 PAM, CPPHA (N-(4-chloro-2-[(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)methyl]phenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide), interacts with a separate allosteric site on mGlu5. Using cell-based assays and brain slice preparations, we characterized the interaction of a potent and efficacious mGlu5 PAM from the CPPHA series termed NCFP (N-(4-chloro-2-((4-fluoro-1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)methyl)phenyl)picolinamide). NCFP binds to the CPPHA site on mGlu5 and potentiates mGlu5-mediated responses in both recombinant and native systems. However, NCFP provides greater mGlu5 subtype selectivity than does CPPHA, making it more suitable for studies of effects on mGlu5 in CNS preparations. Of interest, NCFP does not potentiate responses involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity (LTD/LTP), setting it apart from other previously characterized MPEP site PAMs. This suggests that although mGlu5 PAMs may have similar responses in some systems, they can induce differential effects on mGlu5-mediated physiologic responses in the CNS. Such stimulus bias by mGlu5 PAMs may complicate drug discovery efforts but would also allow for specifically tailored therapies, if pharmacological biases can be attributed to different therapeutic outcomes.
7828655	Dopamine receptor blockade increases dopamine D2 receptor and glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNAs in mouse substantia nigra.	To study the influence of dopaminergic activity on the expression of dopamine D2 receptors and glutamic acid decarboxylase in substantia nigra, mice were treated daily for several days with an irreversibly acting dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptor antagonist N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) or with a selective irreversible D2 dopamine receptor antagonist fluphenazine-N-mustard. Mice were killed 24 h after the last injection. Dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptors were determined by receptor autoradiography, and dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptor mRNA and glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA were determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The results showed that treatment with EEDQ, which blocked 80% to 85% of the dopamine D2 and dopamine D1 receptors in substantia nigra, increased the levels of dopamine D2 receptor mRNA in substantia nigra by about 27%. Treatment with fluphenazine-N-mustard, which blocked about 85% of the dopamine D2 receptors in substantia nigra but had no significant effect on dopamine D1 receptors, increased the levels of dopamine D2 receptor mRNA by about 34%. There were no detectable levels of dopamine D1 receptors, increased the levels of dopamine D2 receptor mRNA by about 34%. There were no detectable levels of dopamine D1 receptor mRNA in substantia nigra either in control animals or in animals treated with the dopamine receptor antagonists. Glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA was expressed in several regions of the mid-brain but only that expressed in substantia nigra was altered by treatment with dopamine receptor antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
15456329	Nabumetone: therapeutic use and safety profile in the management of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.	Nabumetone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory prodrug, which exerts its pharmacological effects via the metabolite 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA). Nabumetone itself is non-acidic and, following absorption, it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to form the main circulating active metabolite (6-MNA) which is a much more potent inhibitor of preferentially cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2. The three major metabolic pathways of nabumetone are O-demethylation, reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, and an oxidative cleavage of the side-chain occurs to yield acetic acid derivatives. Essentially no unchanged nabumetone and < 1% of the major 6-MNA metabolite are excreted unchanged in the urine from which 80% of the dose can be recovered and another 10% in faeces. Nabumetone is clinically used mainly for the management of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to reduce pain and inflammation. The clinical efficacy of nabumetone has also been evaluated in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, soft tissue injuries and juvenile RA. The optimum oral dosage of nabumetone for OA patients is 1 g once daily, which is well tolerated. The therapeutic response is superior to placebo and similar to nonselective COX inhibitors. In RA patients, nabumetone 1 g at bedtime is optimal, but an additional 0.5-1 g can be administered in the morning for patients with persistent symptoms. In RA, nabumetone has shown a comparable clinical efficacy to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), diclofenac, piroxicam, ibuprofen and naproxen. Clinical trials and a decade of worldwide safety data and long-term postmarketing surveillance studies show that nabumetone is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects are those commonly seen with COX inhibitors, which include diarrhoea, dyspepsia, headache, abdominal pain and nausea. In common with other COX inhibitors, nabumetone may increase the risk of GI perforations, ulcerations and bleedings (PUBs). However, several studies show a low incidence of PUBs, and on a par with the numbers reported from studies with COX-2 selective inhibitors and considerably lower than for nonselective COX inhibitors. This has been attributed mainly to the non-acidic chemical properties of nabumetone but also to its COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor profile. Through its metabolite 6-MNA, nabumetone has a dose-related effect on platelet aggregation, but no effect on bleeding time in clinical studies. Furthermore, several short-term studies have shown little to no effect on renal function. Compared with COX-2 selective inhibitors, nabumetone exhibits similar anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in patients with arthritis and there is no evidence of excess GI or other forms of complications to date.
17258485	Vitamin C transport and SVCT1 transporter expression in chick renal proximal tubule cells in culture.	The characteristics of vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ASC) transport were studied in polarized cultured monolayers of the chick (Gallus gallus) renal proximal tubule in Ussing chambers. Under voltage clamp conditions, monolayers responded to apical addition of ASC in a dose-dependent manner, with positive short circuit currents (I(SC)), ranging from 3 microA/cm(2) at 5 microM ASC to a maximal response of 27 microA/cm(2) at 200 microM, and a half-maximal response at 40 microM. There was no effect of basolateral addition of ASC, indicating a polarized transport process. The oxidized form of ASC, dehydroascorbic acid had negligible effects. The I(SC) response to ASC was completely eliminated with Na(+) ion replacement, and was also eliminated by bilateral reduction of bath Cl(-), from 137 to 2.6 mM. There was significant inhibition of the I(SC) responses to 30 microM ASC by the flavanoid quercetin (50 microM) and by 100 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and 5-ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), blockers of anion exchangers and sodium-proton exchangers, respectively. There was no inhibition, however, by the chloride channel blocker 5-nitro-2(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB). Phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA), the phorbol ester activator of protein kinase C, caused a 37% decrease in the I(SC) response to ASC. Chicken-specific primers to an EST homolog of the human vitamin C transporter SVCT1 (SLC23A1) were designed and used to probe transporter expression in these cells. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of chicken SVCT1 in both cultured cells and in freshly isolated proximal tubule fragments. These data indicate the presence of an electrogenic, sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter (SVCT1) in the chick renal proximal tubule. Vitamin C transport and conservation by the kidney is likely to be especially critical in birds, due to high plasma glucose levels and resulting high levels of reactive oxygen species.
23545568	Stable and high-rate overcharge protection for rechargeable lithium batteries.	Rechargeable lithium or lithium-ion cells can be overcharge-protected by an electroactive polymer composite separator. The use of non-woven fibrous membranes instead of conventional microporous membranes as the composite substrates allowed better distribution of the electroactive polymer, which led to improved utilization and a 40-fold increase in sustainable current density. For the first time, stable overcharge protection for hundreds of cycles was demonstrated in several cell chemistries, including LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, LiFePO4, and spinel Li1.05Mn1.95O4 half-cells. Protection at a charging rate as high as 5 C was achieved at a steady state cell potential below 4.85 V.
23152189	2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-mediated production of reactive oxygen species is an essential step in the mechanism of action to accelerate human keratinocyte differentiation.	Chloracne is commonly observed in humans exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD); yet, the mechanism of toxicity is not well understood. Using normal human epidermal keratinocytes, we investigated the mechanism of TCDD-mediated enhancement of epidermal differentiation by integrating functional genomic, metabolomic, and biochemical analyses. TCDD increased the expression of 40% of the genes of the epidermal differentiation complex found on chromosome 1q21 and 75% of the genes required for de novo ceramide biosynthesis. Lipid analysis demonstrated that eight of the nine classes of ceramides were increased by TCDD, altering the ratio of ceramides to free fatty acids. TCDD decreased the expression of the glucose transporter, SLC2A1, and most of the glycolytic transcripts, followed by decreases in glycolytic intermediates, including pyruvate. NADH and Krebs cycle intermediates were decreased, whereas NAD(+) was increased. Mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) reductase activity and the GSH/glutathione disulfide ratio were decreased by TCDD, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by decreased inner mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, and increased production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonists blocked the response of many transcripts to TCDD, and the endpoints of decreased ATP production and differentiation, suggesting regulation by the AHR. Cotreatment of cells with chemical antioxidants or the enzyme catalase blocked the TCDD-mediated acceleration of keratinocyte cornified envelope formation, an endpoint of terminal differentiation. Thus, TCDD-mediated ROS production is a critical step in the mechanism of this chemical to accelerate keratinocyte differentiation.
7981624	Annexin 1 regulation in human epidermal cells.	Annexin 1 (named p35, lipocortin I or calpactin II), initially described as a glucocorticoid induced protein, belongs to a new characterized family of intracellular proteins. In the skin, the role of annexins has still not been elucidated. In a previous study, we reported the localization of annexin 1 in both freshly isolated human epidermal cells and in cultured keratinocytes using immunofluorescence, FACS analysis and immunoblotting techniques. The protein was characterized by Western blot and immunoprecipitation as a 35 kDa protein. Results from in vivo studies confirmed the presence of annexin 1 in basal and suprabasal layers of normal human skin with modified reactivity patterns in hyperproliferative lesions. In the present study, the role of glucocorticoids in annexin 1 regulation was investigated in epidermal cells by Western blot and immunoprecipation assays. In contrast to other studies, we found that glucocorticoid treatment of epidermal cells led to a decrease in annexin 1 content in the cytoplasm and the membranes of cells. As annexin 1 was not detected in the nucleus of cells, we conclude that there was a down regulation of annexin 1 after glucocorticoid treatments rather than a translocation of the protein to the nucleus. Despite the absence of the signal peptide sequence necessary for protein secretion, annexin 1 was released in the keratinocyte culture medium. We found that the protein was secreted only in low Ca2+ medium (0.15 mM), this process required an active metabolism.
11607047	A review of the pharmacological and clinical profile of mirtazapine.	The novel antidepressant mirtazapine has a dual mode of action. It is a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) that acts by antagonizing the adrenergic alpha2-autoreceptors and alpha2-heteroreceptors as well as by blocking 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. It enhances, therefore, the release of norepinephrine and 5-HT1A-mediated serotonergic transmission. This dual mode of action may conceivably be responsible for mirtazapine's rapid onset of action. Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized in the liver. The cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 are mainly responsible for its metabolism. Using once daily dosing, steady-state concentrations are reached after 4 days in adults and 6 days in the elderly. In vitro studies suggest that mirtazapine is unlikely to cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Dry mouth, sedation, and increases in appetite and body weight are the most common adverse effects. In contrast to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mirtazapine has no sexual side effects. The antidepressant efficacy of mirtazapine was established in several placebo-controlled trials. In major depression, its efficacy is comparable to that of amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, or venlafaxine. Mirtazapine also appears to be useful in patients suffering from depression comorbid with anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbance. It seems to be safe and effective during long-term use.
12512695	Vascular effects of COX inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade in transgenic rats harboring mouse renin-2 gene.	Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction is associated with perivascular inflammation and increased superoxide production in the vascular wall. The present study examined the role of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-synthetized eicosanoids in the pathogenesis of Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction in transgenic rats harboring mouse renin-2 gene (mREN2 rats). Five-to-six-week-old, heterozygous mREN2 rats received the following drug regimens for 8 weeks: 1) vehicle, 2) cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (MF-tricyclic [3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl) phenyl)-2(5H)-furanone], 14 mg/kg p.o.), 3) COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor (sulindac, 14 mg/kg p.o.), 4) angiotensin II receptor antagonist (losartan 40 mg/kg p.o.). Normotensive Sprague Dawley (SD) rats served as controls. In vitro vascular responses of the descending aorta and renal artery were studied using organ bath system. mREN2 rats developed pronounced hypertension which was associated with impaired endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vascular relaxations in the aorta. In contrast, the relaxation responses of the renal arteries remained largely unchanged in mREN2 rats. Urinary NO, excretion, a marker of total body NO generation, was also decreased in mREN2 rats. Neither non-selective COX inhibitor sulindac nor COX-2 selective MF-tricyclic were capable of preventing Ang II-induced hypertension or endothelial dysfunction in mREN2 rats, whereas ATi receptor antagonist losartan completely normalized blood pressure, vascular relaxation responses as well as urinary NOx excretion. Our findings indicate that NO synthesis and/or bioavailability as well as the sensitivity of arterial smooth muscle cells to NO are decreased in mREN2 rats. The present study also demonstrated that COX does not play a central role in the pathogenesis of Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunction in mREN2 rats.
23237733	Isoliquiritigenin showed strong inhibitory effects towards multiple UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoform-catalyzed 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) glucuronidation.	Isoliquiritigenin, a herbal ingredient with chalcone structure, has been speculated to be able to inhibit one of the most drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibition of isoliquiritigenin towards important UGT isoforms in the liver and intestine, including UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9 and 1A10. The recombinant UGT-catalyzed 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) glucuronidation was used as probe reactions. The results showed that 100μM of isoliquiritigenin inhibited the activity of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10 by 95.2%, 76.1%, 78.9%, 87.2%, 67.2%, 94.8%, and 91.7%, respectively. The data fitting using Dixon plot and Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that the inhibition of UGT1A1, UGT1A9 and UGT1A10 by isoliquiritigenin was all best fit to the competitive inhibition, and the second plot using the slopes from the Lineweaver-Burk plot versus isoliquiritigenin concentrations was used to calculate the inhibition kinetic parameter (K(i)) to be 0.7μM, 0.3μM, and 18.3μM for UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10, respectively. All these results indicated the risk of clinical application of isoliquiritigenin on the drug-drug interaction and other possible diseases induced by the inhibition of isoliquiritigenin towards these UGT isoforms.
23361305	Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) and low mitochondrial membrane potential are specific for Barth syndrome.	Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked mitochondrial defect characterised by dilated cardiomyopathy, neutropaenia and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGCA). We report on two affected brothers with c.646G > A (p.G216R) TAZ gene mutations. The pathogenicity of the mutation, as indicated by the structure-based functional analyses, was further confirmed by abnormal monolysocardiolipin/cardiolipin ratio in dry blood spots of the patients as well as the occurrence of this mutation in another reported BTHS proband. In both brothers, 2D-echocardiography revealed some features of left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) despite marked differences in the course of the disease; the eldest child presented with isolated cardiomyopathy from late infancy, whereas the youngest showed severe lactic acidosis without 3-MGCA during the neonatal period. An examination of the patients' fibroblast cultures revealed that extremely low mitochondrial membrane potentials (mtΔΨ about 50 % of the control value) dominated other unspecific mitochondrial changes detected (respiratory chain dysfunction, abnormal ROS production and depressed antioxidant defense). 1) Our studies confirm generalised mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle and the fibroblasts of BTHS patients, especially a severe impairment in the mtΔΨ and the inhibition of complex V activity. It can be hypothesised that impaired mtΔΨ and mitochondrial ATP synthase activity may contribute to episodes of cardiac arrhythmia that occurred unexpectedly in BTHS patients. 2) Severe lactic acidosis without 3-methylglutaconic aciduria in male neonates as well as an asymptomatic mild left ventricular noncompaction may characterise the ranges of natural history of Barth syndrome.
9353417	Differential regulation of D2 and D4 dopamine receptor mRNAs in the primate cerebral cortex vs. neostriatum: effects of chronic treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs.	The RNase Protection Assay was used to examine the regulation of D2 and D4 dopamine receptor mRNAs in the cerebral cortex and neostriatum of nonhuman primates after chronic treatment with a wide spectrum of antipsychotic medications (chlorpromazine, clozapine, haloperidol, molindone, olanzapine, pimozide, remoxipride and risperidone). Tiapride, a D2 antagonist that lacks antipsychotic activity, was also included. All drugs were administered orally for 6 months at doses recommended for humans. All antipsychotic drug treatments examined in this study caused a statistically significant up-regulation of both the long and short isoforms of the D2 receptor mRNAs in the prefrontal and temporal cortex. Tiapride, in contrast, significantly up-regulated only the level of D2-long mRNA in these areas. The same drug treatments produced less uniform effects in the neostriatum than in the cortex: clozapine and olanzapine failed to significantly elevate either D2-long or D2-short receptor messages in this structure unlike all other drugs, including tiapride. In both the cerebral cortex and striatum, D4 receptor mRNA was upregulated by certain typical (chlorpromazine and haloperidol) and certain atypical (clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone) antipsychotic agents as well as by tiapride. Other drugs of the typical (molindone and pimozide) and atypical (remoxipride) classes had no effect on D4 mRNA levels in either cortical or striatal tissue. The finding that up-regulation of D2 dopamine receptor mRNAs was a consistently observed effect of a wide range of antipsychotic agents in the cerebral cortex but not in the neostriatum, coupled with the fact that the D2-short isoforms in the cortex were not regulated by a nonantipsychotic D2 antagonist, tiapride, draws attention to the importance of the D2 dopamine receptor in the cerebral cortex as a potentially critical, common site of action of antipsychotic medications.
14585280	Inhibitors of DNA methylation in the treatment of hematological malignancies and MDS.	DNA methylation abnormalities have recently emerged as one of the most frequent molecular changes in hematopoietic neoplasms. Since methylation and transcriptional status are inversely correlated, the hypermethylation of genes involved in cell-cycle control and apoptosis could have a pathogenetic role in the development of cancer. In particular, high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary leukemias show a high prevalence of tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. The progression of chronic myeloproliferative diseases and of myelodysplastic syndromes, as well as that of lymphoproliferative diseases, is associated with an increased methylation rate, pointing to a role for hypermethylation of critical promoter regions in the transformation to more aggressive phenotypes. In the same line, a significantly worse prognosis has been shown for patients with hypermethylation of several genes compared to that of patients with unmethylated genes. For these reasons, the use of irreversible DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, such as 5-azacytidine and Decitabine, appears to be a promising option for the treatment of MDS and acute myeloid leukemia. In clinical trials, Azacytidine results in a significantly higher response rate, improved quality of life, reduced risk of leukemic transformation, and improved survival compared to supportive care. Similarly, Decitabine showed favorable results, promising response rates, a good nonhematologic toxicity profile, and a trend for better survival compared to intensive chemotherapy, particularly in older patients. The synergistic effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors, including phenylbutyrate (PB), in reactivating silenced genes encouraged clinical studies on the combination of PB and demethylating agents in hematological diseases, characterized by p15 silencing. The sequential administration of a "first generation" demethylating agent and HDAC inhibitors gave preliminary evidence of a reduced methylation of target genes, as also described with Decitabine. Clinical trials are still ongoing, and preliminary data indicate for the first time that the natural history of MDS may be changed by a non-intensive treatment, characterized by an outstanding toxicity profile.
23211364	AT1 receptor antagonism is proangiogenic in the brain: BDNF a novel mediator.	Candesartan is an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) that has been to shown to limit ischemic stroke and improve stroke outcome. In experimental stroke, candesartan induces a proangiogenic effect that is partly attributable to vascular endothelial growth factor. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family that has been reported to have angiogenic effects and play an important role in recovery after stroke. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the role of BDNF in the proangiogenic effect of candesartan in the brain under hypertensive conditions. Accordingly, spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with candesartan, and brain tissue samples were collected for quantification of BDNF expression. In addition, human cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells were treated with either low-dose (1 ƒM) or high-dose (1 µM) angiotensin II alone or in combination with candesartan (0.16 µM) to assess the effect of candesartan treatment and BDNF involvement in the behavior of endothelial cells. Candesartan significantly increased the expression of BDNF in the SHR (P < 0.05). In addition, candesartan reversed the antiangiogenic effect of the 1-µM dose of AngII (P = 0.0001). The observed effects of candesartan were ablated by neutralizing the effects of BDNF. Treatment with the AT2 antagonist PD-123319 significantly reduced tube-like formation in endothelial cells. AT2 stimulation induced the BDNF expression and migration (P < 0.05). In conclusion, candesartan exerts a proangiogenic effect on brain microvascular endothelial cells treated with angiotensin II. This response is attributable to increased BDNF expression and is mediated through stimulation of the AT2 receptor.
23624810	Antiaggressive activity of central oxytocin in male rats.	RATIONALE: A substantial body of research suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin promotes social affiliative behaviors in a wide range of animals including humans. However, its antiaggressive action has not been unequivocally demonstrated in male laboratory rodents. OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal was to examine the putative serenic effect of oxytocin in a feral strain (wild type Groningen, WTG) of rats that generally show a much broader variation and higher levels of intermale aggression than commonly used laboratory strains of rats. METHODS: Resident animals were intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered with different doses of synthetic oxytocin and oxytocin receptor antagonist, alone and in combination, in order to manipulate brain oxytocin functioning and to assess their behavioral response to an intruder. RESULTS: Our data clearly demonstrate that acute icv administered oxytocin produces dose-dependent and receptor-selective changes in social behavior, reducing aggression and potentiating social exploration. These antiaggressive effects are stronger in the more offensive rats. On the other hand, administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist tends to increase (nonsignificantly) aggression only in low-medium aggressive animals. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that transiently enhancing brain oxytocin function has potent antiaggressive effects, whereas its attenuation tends to enhance aggressiveness. In addition, a possible inverse relationship between trait aggression and endogenous oxytocinergic signaling is revealed. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of brain oxytocinergic signaling for regulating intermale offensive aggression. This study supports the suggestion that oxytocin receptor agonists could clinically be useful for curbing heightened aggression seen in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders like antisocial personality disorder, autism, and addiction.
10626836	Lithium modulates desensitization of the glutamate receptor subtype gluR3 in Xenopus oocytes.	Analysis of splice variants and site-directed mutants of the AMPA receptor GluR3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes has shown that lithium produces a large potentiation of the GluR3 flop splice variant and suggested that lithium might inhibit rapid desensitization, which is characteristic of this receptor (Karkanias, N. and Papke, R., Subtype-specific effects of lithium on glutamate receptor function. J. Neurophysiol., 81 (1999) 1506-1512). We now show that mutation of the 769R/ G desensitization site (Lomeli, H.M.J., Melcher, T., Hoger, T., Geiger, J.R., Kuner, T., Monyer, H., Higuchi, M.B.A. and Seeburg, P.H, Control of kinetic properties of AMPA receptor channels by nuclear RNA editing. Science, 9(266) (1994) 1709-1713) greatly attenuates the lithium-induced potentiation of GluR3. Additionally, experiments with the non-desensitizing site-directed mutant GluR3(L507Y) (Stern-Bach, Y., Russo, S., Neuman, M. and Rosenmund, C., A point mutation in the glutamate binding site blocks desensitization of AMPA receptors. Neuron, 21 (1998) 907-918) further confirms that lithium enhances GluR3 responses by reducing desensitization, since lithium's effects are reversed in this mutant. Lithium's effects on GluR3 desensitization are distinct from the effects of aniracetam on desensitization. Specifically, aniracetam, which potentiates wild-type AMPA receptors, is ineffective on the non-desensitizing GluR3(L507Y) mutant, but has synergistic effects with lithium on wild-type receptors.
23536522	The effects of gender difference on monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats.	The present study aimed to compare the effect of gender difference on hemodynamic consequences in the development of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension in rat. The effect of antioxidant enzyme systems on the development of pulmonary hypertension mediated by the phytotoxin MCT and the effect of gender on these antioxidant systems were also investigated. For this purpose, the right ventricular pressures (RVPs) and right ventricular/heart weight (HW) ratios were compared between groups and the glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were determined in lung and liver tissue samples of rats. RVP and right ventricular/HW ratios significantly increased in the MCT group compared to the control group. In the MCT group, RVP was significantly higher in males than females. MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension resulted in decreased GSH level, decreased GST and SOD activities and increased CAT activity in lung and liver tissues of both male and female rats. In addition, the lung and liver GSH level and GST and SOD levels were higher in female control rats compared to male control rats. The results of the present study, that antioxidant enzyme activities were different between the groups, highlight the possible role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats. Moreover, the lower antioxidant defense capacity of male rats than female rats may be considered as a cause of more aggressive course of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension in males compared to females.
23198810	Profluorogenic reductase substrate for rapid, selective, and sensitive visualization and detection of human cancer cells that overexpress NQO1.	Achieving the vision of identifying and quantifying cancer-related events and targets for future personalized oncology is predicated on the existence of synthetically accessible and economically viable probe molecules fully able to report the presence of these events and targets in a rapid and highly selective and sensitive fashion. Delineated here are the design and evaluation of a newly synthesized turn-on probe whose intense fluorescent reporter signature is revealed only through probe activation by a specific intracellular enzyme present in tumor cells of multiple origins. Quenching of molecular probe fluorescence is achieved through unique photoinduced electron transfer between the naphthalimide dye reporter and a covalently attached, quinone-based enzyme substrate. Fluorescence of the reporter dye is turned on by rapid removal of the quinone quencher, an event that immediately occurs only after highly selective, two-electron reduction of the sterically and conformationally restricted quinone substrate by the cancer-associated human NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase isozyme 1 (hNQO1). Successes of the approach include rapid differentiation of NQO1-expressing and -nonexpressing cancer cell lines via the unaided eye, flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, and two-photon microscopy. The potential for use of the turn-on probe in longer-term cellular studies is indicated by its lack of influence on cell viability and its in vitro stability.
11426832	Characterization of organic anion transport inhibitors using cells stably expressing human organic anion transporters.	The organic anion transport system is involved in the tubular excretion of various clinically important drugs. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of various organic anion transport inhibitors on organic anion transport using proximal tubule cells stably expressing human organic anion transporter 1 (human-OAT1) and human-OAT3, which are localized to the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule. Organic anion transport inhibitors including betamipron, cilastatin, KW-3902 (8-(noradamantan-3-yl)-1,3-dipropylxanthine) and probenecid significantly inhibited human-OAT1- and human-OAT3-mediated organic anion uptake in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetic analyses revealed that these inhibitions were competitive. The Ki values of betamipron, cilastatin, KW-3902 and probencid for human-OAT1 were 23.6, 1470, 7.82 and 12.1 microM, whereas those for human-OAT3 were 48.3, 231, 3.70 and 9.0 microM. These results suggest that betamipron and probenecid could inhibit both human-OAT1- and human-OAT3-mediated organic anion transport in vivo, whereas cilastatin could inhibit only human-OAT3-mediated one. In contrast, KW-3902 did not exert the effects of significance, whereas KW-3902 was the most potent.
10047461	Cyclin E-cdk2 activation is associated with cell cycle arrest and inhibition of DNA replication induced by the thymidylate synthase inhibitor Tomudex.	Tomudex (ZD1694) is a specific antifolate-based thymidylate synthase inhibitor active in a variety of solid tumor malignancies. Studies were carried out in vitro to evaluate downstream molecular alterations induced as a consequence of the potent and sustained inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex. Twenty-four hours following the initial 2-h treatment with Tomudex, human A253 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, not expressing p53 and p21(WAF1), were accumulated with DNA content characteristic of early S phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant reduction of cells in G1 and G2/M phases. The changes in cyclin and cdk protein expression and their kinase activities were examined in control and drug-treated A253 cells. Tomudex treatment resulted in the decrease in p27(kip1) expression, with an increase in cyclin E and cdk2 protein expression and kinase activities 24 h after a 2-h exposure. Although cyclin A protein expression was markedly increased, cyclin A kinase activity was only slightly increased. Cyclin D1, cyclin B, cdk4, and cdc2 protein expression and kinase activities remain constant. Lack of activation of cyclin A- and B-cdc2 was associated with a reduced proportion of cells in G2/M phases. Increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression was accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis, with a decrease in E2F-1 expression. These results propose that cyclin E-cdk2 kinase can negatively regulate DNA replication. The studies with dThyd rescue from cyclin E-cdk2 protein overexpression and growth inhibition by Tomudex indicate that increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression is associated with effective inhibition of thymidylate synthase and resultant dNTP pool imbalance. Provision of dThyd more than 24 h after exposure to Tomudex allowed cells to replicate DNA for a single cycle back to G1, but did not prevent the profound growth-inhibitory effect manifested in the following 5 days. Tomudex treatment resulted in a time-dependent induction of the megabase DNA fragments, followed by secondary 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation. The 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation may be derived from the inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with cyclin E-cdk2 activation. These results suggest that the megabase DNA fragmentation is induced as a consequence of inhibition of thymidylate synthase by Tomudex and kilobase DNA fragmentation may correlate with the reduction of p27(kip1) expression and the increase in cyclin E and cdk2 kinase activities. Activation of cyclin E and cdk2 kinases allows cells to transit from G1 to S phase accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins associated with growth inhibition and DNA damage by Tomudex are not p53 dependent.
9950599	Oxidative stress induces differential gene expression in a human lens epithelial cell line.	PURPOSE: To identify differentially expressed genes in a human lens epithelial cell line exposed to oxidative stress. METHODS: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) differential display was used to evaluate differential gene expression in a human lens epithelial cell line (SRA 01-04) when cells were exposed for 3 hours to a single bolus of 200 microM hydrogen peroxide. Differentially expressed genes were identified through DNA sequencing and a nucleotide database search. Differential expression was confirmed by northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. RESULTS: Using 18 primer sets, 28 RT-PCR products were differentially expressed between control and hydrogen peroxide-treated cells. In stressed cells, mitochondrial transcripts nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase subunit 4 and cytochrome b were downregulated 4-fold. Of the cytoplasmic mRNAs, glutamine cyclotransferase decreased 10-fold, whereas cytokine-inducible nuclear protein, alternative splicing factor 2, and beta-hydroxyisobutyryl-coenzyme A hydrolase increased 2-, 4-, and 10-fold, respectively. Analysis of mitochondrial transcripts in a 24-hour time course showed that NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 mRNA decreased by 2-fold as early as 1 hour after oxidative stress, whereas the rate of decrease was slower for cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase III, and 16S rRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress induced specific expressed gene changes in hydrogen peroxide-treated lens cells, including genes involved in cellular respiration and mRNA and peptide processing. These early changes may reflect pathways involved in the defense, pathology, or both of the lens epithelium, which is exposed to oxidative stress throughout life.
18480678	Differential pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of methylphenidate enantiomers: does chirality matter?	d,l-threo-methylphenidate (MPH) is an effective first-line treatment for the symptoms associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. threo-methylphenidate inhibits the dopamine transporter and the norepinephrine transporter, resulting in elevations of these monoamines after impulse release. Although MPH has long been administered as a racemic mixture of the 2 enantiomers, d-MPH and l-MPH, converging lines of evidence drawn from investigations using in vitro systems, animal models, and humans indicate that it is predominantly, if not exclusively, d-MPH that mediates the pharmacological/therapeutic actions of MPH. In both rodent and primate animal models, the binding of radiolabeled d-MPH to dopamine transporter was found to be selective, saturable, and reversible, whereas binding of l-MPH was diffuse and nonspecific. The behavioral effects of the enantiomers of MPH have been tested in several animal models, and results indicate these observed behavioral changes are likewise mediated by d-MPH, whereas l-MPH has little or no effect.The contribution of the l-isomer to the overall pharmacological profile of the racemate remains unclear, owing to several studies suggesting that l-MPH may not be merely an inert isomeric ballast. For example, behavioral studies conducted in rats demonstrate an attenuation of the effect of d-MPH in animals pretreated with l-MPH, suggesting that l-MPH may interfere with the action of the active enantiomer. The importance of MPH chirality to central nervous system MPH receptor targeting has culminated in human imaging studies revealing that d-MPH binds specifically to striatal structures, whereas l-MPH binding is nonspecific. Taken together, data from in vitro, animal, and human studies support the premise that the d-enantiomer of MPH mediates the neurophysiological actions of MPH and therefore likely mediates its clinical efficacy.
8697470	[Inactivated factor VII exercises a powerful antithrombotic activity in an experimental model of recurrent arterial thrombosis].	The extrinsic coagulation pathway is activated when tissue factor (TF) is exposed as a consequence of arterial damage. TF binds to factor VII (FVII) or activated FVII (FVIIa), generating a complex that activates both FX and FIX, ultimately leading to thrombin formation. To determine whether inhibition of FVII binding to TF would result in antithrombotic effects, active site-blocked FVIIa (FVIIai) was used in a rabbit model of intravascular thrombus formation. In addition, to study the interaction between extrinsic coagulation pathway activation and platelet aggregation, in the same model of intravascular thrombus formation, recombinant human FVIIa was administered in antiplatelet-treated rabbits. Cyclic flow variations (CFVs), due to recurrent thrombus formation, were initiated by placing an external constrictor around the endothelially-injured rabbit carotid arteries (Folt's model). Carotid blood flow was measured continuously by a Doppler flow probe placed proximally to the constrictor. CFVs were induced in 29 New Zealand White rabbits. After CFVs were observed for 30 min, the animals were randomly divided in four groups: 5 animals received via a small catheter (26G) placed proximally to the stenosis, an intra-arterial infusion of human recombinant FVIIai (0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min); 9 animals received AP-1, a monoclonal antibody against rabbit TF (0.1 mg/kg i.v. bolus); 7 animals received ridogrel, a dual thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor and thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist (10 mg/kg i.v. bolus); finally, 8 rabbits received aurintrycarboxilic acid (ATA), an inhibitor of platelet glycoprotein Ib/von Willebrand factor interaction (10 mg/kg i.v. bolus). FVIIai abolished CFVs in 5 of 5 animals (CFV frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 106 +/- 9% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline). AP-1 abolished CFVs in 7 of 9 animals (CFV frequency minutes 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05; carotid blood flow velocity minutes 58 +/- 35% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline). Finally, in all the animals receiving ridogrel or ATA CFVs were abolished (CFV frequency 0 cycles/hour; p < 0.05 in both groups; carotid blood flow velocity, respectively 62 +/- 32 and 66 +/- 40% of the baseline values; NS vs baseline in both groups). Thirty minutes following inhibition of CFVs, in the FVIIai treated rabbits, human recombinant FVIIa was infused, via the small catheter placed proximally to the stenosis, at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg/min for 10 min. In the other three groups, FVIIa, at the same dose, was infused i.v. Infusion of FVIIa restored CFVs in all FVIIai treated animals and in 6 of 7 AP-1 treated animals, thus indicating that AP-1 and FVIIai bindings to TF was competitive and was replaced by FVIIa. Infusion of FVIIa failed to restore CFVs in ridogrel e ATA treated rabbits (1 of 7 and 0 of 8 rabbits, respectively), showing that activation of extrinsic coagulation by FVIIa was overcome by inhibition of platelet function. Activated partial thromboplastin time, and ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to ADP and thrombin, were not different after FVIIai infusion, while prothrombin time was slightly but significantly prolonged as compared to baseline values. Thus, FVII-VIIa plays an important role in initiating thrombus formation in vivo. Administration of FVIIai exerts a potent antithrombotic effects in this model without affecting systemic coagulation. In addition, in this model platelets exert an important role in arterial thrombosis, since in the presence of inhibition of platelet function, activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway failed to restore thrombus formation.
23323829	Design and application of anthracene derivative with aggregation-induced emission charateristics for visualization and monitoring of erythropoietin unfolding.	Erythropoietin (EPO) is an attractive protein-unfolding/folding model because of its high degree of unfolding and folding reversibility and intermediate size. Due to its function for regulating red blood cell production by stimulating late erythroid precursor cells, EPO presents obvious values to biological research. A nonemissive anthracene derivative, that is 9,10-bis[4-(3-sulfonatopropoxyl)-styryl]anthracene sodium salt (BSPSA), with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) charateristics shows a novel phenomenon of AIE when EPO is added. The AIE biosensor for EPO shows the limit of detection is 1 × 10(-9) M. Utilizing the AIE feature of BSPSA, the unfolding process of EPO using guanidine hydrochloride is monitored, which indicates three steps for the folding structures of EPO to transform to random coil. Computational modeling suggests that the BSPSA luminogens prefer docking in the hydrophobic cavity in the EPO folding structures, and the assembly of BSPSA in this cavity makes the AIE available, making the monitoring of unfolding of EPO possible.
23404739	Optimization of marine triterpene sipholenols as inhibitors of breast cancer migration and invasion.	Sipholenol A, a sipholane triterpene isolated from the Red Sea sponge Callyspongia siphonella, has the ability to reverse multidrug resistance in cancer cells that overexpress P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Here, the antimigratory activity of sipholenol A and analogues are reported against the highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in a wound-healing assay. Sipholenol A and sipholenone A were semisynthetically optimized using ligand-based strategies to generate structurally diverse analogues in an attempt to maximize their antimigratory activity. A total of 22 semisynthetic ester, ether, oxime, and carbamate analogues were generated and identified by extensive one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses. Sipholenol A 4β-4-chlorobenzoate and 19,20-anhydrosipholenol A 4β-4-chlorobenzoate esters were the most potent of all tested analogues in the wound-healing assay, with IC(50) values of 5.3 and 5.9 μM, respectively. Generally, ester derivatives showed better antimigratory activities than the carbamate analogues. A KINOMEscan of 19,20-anhydrosipholenol A 4β-benzoate ester against 451 human protein kinases identified protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) as a potential target. In breast tumor cells, PTK6 promotes growth factor signaling and migration, and as such the semisynthetic sipholanes were evaluated for their ability to inhibit PTK6 phosphorylation in vitro. The two analogues with the highest antimigratory activities, sipholenol A 4β-4-chlorobenzoate and 19,20-anhydrosipholenol A 4β-4-chlorobenzoate esters, also exhibited the most potent inhibition of PTK6 phosphorylation inhibition. None of the compounds exhibited cytotoxicity in a normal epithelial breast cell line. These derivatives were evaluated in an in vitro invasion assay, where sipholenol A succinate potently inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell invasion at 10 μM. These results highlight sipholane triterpenoids as novel antimigratory marine natural products with potential for further development as agents for the control of metastatic breast malignancies.
23258671	Super-stable ultrafine beta-tungsten nanocrystals with metastable phase and related magnetism.	Ultrafine tungsten nanocrystals (average size of 3 nm) with a metastable phase (beta-tungsten with A15 structure, β-W) have been prepared by laser ablation of tungsten in liquid nitrogen. The as-prepared metastable nanocrystals exhibited super-stablity, and can keep the same metastable structure over a period of 6 months at room temperature. This super-stability is attributed to the nanosized confinement effect of ultrafine nanocrystals. The magnetism measurements showed that the β-W nanocrystals have weak ferromagnetic properties at 2 K, which may arise from surface defects and unpaired electrons on the surface of the ultrafine nanocrystals. These findings provided useful information for the application of ultrafine β-W nanocrystals in microelectronics and spintronics.
10403635	Success of pyridostigmine, physostigmine, eptastigmine and phosphotriesterase treatments in acute sarin intoxication.	The acute toxicity of organophosphorus (OP) compounds in mammals is due to their irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the nervous system, which leads to increased synaptic acetylcholine levels. The protective actions of intravenously (i.v.) administered pyridostigmine, physostigmine, eptastigmine, and an organophosphate hydrolase, phosphotriesterase, in acute sarin intoxication were studied in mice. The acute intragastric (i.g.) toxicity (LD50) of sarin with and without the pretreatments was tested by the up-and-down method. The mice received pyridostigmine (0.06 mg/kg body weight), physostigmine (0.09 mg/kg body weight), the physostigmine derivative eptastigmine (0.90 mg/kg body weight) or phosphotriesterase (104 U/g, 10.7 microg/g body weight) 10 min prior to the i.g. administration of sarin. Physostigmine was also administered with phosphotriesterase. Phosphotriesterase was the most effective antidote in sarin intoxication. The LD50 value for sarin increased 3.4-fold in mice receiving phosphotriesterase. Physostigmine was the most effective carbamate in sarin exposure. The protective ratios of physostigmine and pyridostigmine were 1.5- and 1.2-1.3-fold, respectively. Eptastigmine did not give any protection against sarin toxicity. Both the phosphotriesterase and physostigmine treatments protected the brain AChE activities measured 24 h after sarin exposure. In phosphotriesterase and physostigmine-treated mice, a 4- and 2-fold higher sarin dose, respectively, was needed to cause a 50% inhibition of brain AChE activity. Moreover, the combination of phosphotriesterase-physostigmine increased the LD50 value for sarin 4.3-fold. The animals pretreated with phosphotriesterase-ephysostigmine tolerated four times the lethal dose in control animals, furthermore their survival time was 2-3 h in comparison to 20 min in controls. In conclusion, phosphotriesterase and physostigmine were the most effective treatments against sarin intoxication. However, eptastigmine did not provide any protection against sarin toxicity.
23585380	Dual Growth Factor Delivery Using Biocompatible Core-Shell Microcapsules for Angiogenesis.	An optimized electrodropping system produces homogeneous core-shell microcapsules (C-S MCs) by using poly(L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and alginate. Fluorescence imaging clearly shows the C-S domain in the MC. For release control, the use of high-molecular-weight PLGA (HMW 270 000) restrains the initial burst release of protein compared to that of low-MW PLGA (LMW 40 000). Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly of chitosan and alginate on MCs is also useful in controlling the release profile of biomolecules. LBL (7-layer) treatment is effective in suppressing the initial burst release of protein compared to no LBL (0-layer). The difference of cumulative albumin release between HMW (7-layer LBL) and LMW (0-layer LBL) PLGA is determined to be more than 40% on day 5. When dual angiogenic growth factors (GFs), such as platelet-derived GF (PDGF) and vascular endothelial GF (VEGF), are encapsulated separately in the core and shell domains, respectively, the VEGF release rate is much greater than that of PDGF, and the difference of the cumulative release percentage between the two GFs is about 30% on day 7 with LMW core PLGA and more than 45% with HMW core PLGA. As for the angiogenic potential of MC GFs with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the fluorescence signal of CD31+ suggests that the angiogenic sprout of ECs is more active in MC-mediated GF delivery than conventional GF delivery, and this difference is significant, based on the number of capillary branches in the unit area. This study demonstrates that the fabrication of biocompatible C-S MCs is possible, and that the release control of biomolecules is adjustable. Furthermore, MC-mediated GFs remain in an active form and can upregulate the angiogenic activity of ECs.
15276688	Extracellular serotonin, dopamine and glutamate levels are elevated in the hypothalamus in a serotonin syndrome animal model induced by tranylcypromine and fluoxetine.	Serotonin (5-HT) syndrome is a potentially fatal condition associated with various combinations of serotonergic drugs. The present study was undertaken to demonstrate that nervous systems other than the 5-HT system also participate in the pathophysiology of 5-HT syndrome. Concentrations of 5-HT, dopamine (DA) and glutamate in the hypothalamus were measured in two different 5-HT syndrome animal models using a microdialysis technique. The first model was induced by tranylcypromine, a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (3.5 mg/kg) and fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (10 mg/kg). The second model was induced by clorgyline, an MAO-A inhibitor (1.2 mg/kg) and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, a precursor of 5-HT (5-HTP) (80 mg/kg). In the first model, the levels of 5-HT and DA increased by 40-fold and 44-fold, respectively, compared with the preadministration levels. In the second model, the concentrations of 5-HT increased by up to 140-fold, whereas DA levels increased by only 10-fold, of the preadministration levels. Although the level of glutamate in the second model barely changed, a delayed increase in the glutamate level was observed in the first model. These findings suggest that not only hyperactivity of the 5-HT system, but also hyperactivity of the DA system, are present in 5-HT syndrome, and that the glutamatergic system is influenced in some 5-HT syndrome cases in which the DA concentration markedly increases.
15561708	Characterization of the NifS-like domain of ABA3 from Arabidopsis thaliana provides insight into the mechanism of molybdenum cofactor sulfuration.	The molybdenum cofactor sulfurase ABA3 from Arabidopsis thaliana specifically regulates the activity of the molybdenum enzymes aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase by converting their molybdenum cofactor from the desulfo-form into the sulfo-form. ABA3 is a two-domain protein with an NH2-terminal domain sharing significant similarities to NifS proteins that catalyze the decomposition of l-cysteine to l-alanine and elemental sulfur for iron-sulfur cluster synthesis. Although different in its physiological function, the mechanism of ABA3 for sulfur mobilization was found to be similar to NifS proteins. The protein binds a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor and a substrate-derived persulfide intermediate, and site-directed mutagenesis of strictly conserved binding sites for the cofactor and the persulfide demonstrated that they are essential for molybdenum cofactor sulfurase activity. In vitro, the NifS-like domain of ABA3 activates aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase in the absence of the C-terminal domain, but in vivo, the C-terminal domain is required for proper activation of both target enzymes. In addition to its cysteine desulfurase activity, ABA3-NifS also exhibits selenocysteine lyase activity. Although l-selenocysteine is unlikely to be a natural substrate for ABA3, it is decomposed more efficiently than l-cysteine. Besides mitochondrial AtNFS1 and plastidial AtNFS2, which are both proposed to be involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation, ABA3 is proposed to be a third and cytosolic NifS-like cysteine desulfurase in A. thaliana. However, the sulfur transferase activity of ABA3 is used for post-translational activation of molybdenum enzymes rather than for iron-sulfur cluster assembly.
7911719	Functional studies on alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating inotropic effects in rat right ventricle.	1. We have studied the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating inotropic effects of adrenaline in rat right ventricle and the Ca2+ sources used to elicit these effects. alpha 1A-Adrenoceptor-mediated contractile effects in rat vas deferens were studied for comparison in some cases. 2. Treatment with chloroethylclonidine did not affect the maximal beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic effects in rat right ventricle or the maximal alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-mediated contractile effects in rat vas deferens; it did not alter the potency of isoprenaline in the ventricle and reduced the potency of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists in vas deferens only slightly. Treatment of right ventricular strips with CdCl2 markedly reduced resting tension and enhanced maximal inotropic effects of isoprenaline but did not affect its potency. 3. Inactivation of cardiac alpha 1B-adrenoceptors by treatment with chloroethylclonidine slightly enhanced the maximal inotropic effects of the full agonist, adrenaline and of several partial agonists. 4. Schild analysis of inhibition experiments with the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists, 5-methyl-urapidil and (+/-)-tamsulosin, demonstrated that adrenaline causes its inotropic effects mainly via the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor subtype. Schild analysis of 5-methyl-urapidil inhibition experiments in chloroethylclonidine-treated ventricles indicated that only alpha 1A-adrenoceptors mediate the inotropic effects of adrenaline following inactivation of the alpha 1B-adrenoceptors. 5. In control ventricles the organic Ca2+ entry blocker, nitrendipine and treatment with the inorganic Ca2+ entry blocker, CdCl2 did not reduce inotropic effects of adrenaline whereas ryanodine treatment inhibited them. In contrast, nitrendipine and CdCl2 treatment had major inhibitory effects in chloroethylclonidine-treated but lacked inhibitory effects in phenoxybenzamine-treated ventricular strips. 6. We conclude that inotropic effects of adrenaline in rat heart are mediated mainly by alpha 1B-adrenoceptors via release of Ca2+ from an intracellular pool. Following inactivation of alpha 1B-adrenoceptors by chloroethylclonidine treatment, alpha lA-adrenoceptors can fully compensate and mediate inotropic effects by promoting influx of extracellular Ca2+ at least partly via voltage-operated channels.Therefore, we speculate that alpha 1B-adrenoceptors exert a tonic inhibitory effect on alpha 1A-adrenoceptors.
17372252	An international case-control study of glutathione transferase and functionally related polymorphisms and risk of primary adult brain tumors.	BACKGROUND: Glutathione transferases (GST) detoxify environmental and endogenous compounds and levels of two polymorphic GST proteins, GSTM3 and GSTP1, are high in the brain. Previous studies of GSTM3 and GSTP1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk have produced inconsistent results, whereas the GSTM3 -63 variant is newly identified and, therefore, has not yet been studied in this context. We therefore examined associations between GSTM3 -63, GSTM3 *A/*B, GSTP1 105, and GSTP1 114 variants and adult brain tumor risk and the interaction of the effects of these same polymorphisms with cigarette smoking. In addition, the enzymes NQO1 and CYP1A1 alter susceptibility to oxidative brain damage. Because there is less previous evidence for a role of NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 variants, we restricted analysis of these variants to a small preliminary study. METHODS: We genotyped DNA collected for an international population-based case-control study of 725 glioma cases, 329 of which were glioblastoma cases, 546 meningioma cases and 1,612 controls. Study participants were residents of Sweden, southeast England, Denmark, and Finland. RESULTS: We found no associations between the GSTM3, GSTP1, NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, or GSTT1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk with the possible exception of a weak association between the G-C (Val-Ala) GSTP1 105/114 haplotype and glioma [odds ratio (OR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.54, 0.99], nor was there an interaction between the effects of the GSTM3 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and cigarette smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we observed no strong evidence for an association between GST or related enzyme polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk.
23086035	PGC-1α improves glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle in an activity-dependent manner.	Metabolic disorders are a major burden for public health systems globally. Regular exercise improves metabolic health. Pharmacological targeting of exercise mediators might facilitate physical activity or amplify the effects of exercise. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) largely mediates musculoskeletal adaptations to exercise, including lipid refueling, and thus constitutes such a putative target. Paradoxically, forced expression of PGC-1α in muscle promotes diet-induced insulin resistance in sedentary animals. We show that elevated PGC-1α in combination with exercise preferentially improves glucose homeostasis, increases Krebs cycle activity, and reduces the levels of acylcarnitines and sphingosine. Moreover, patterns of lipid partitioning are altered in favor of enhanced insulin sensitivity in response to combined PGC-1α and exercise. Our findings reveal how physical activity improves glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, our data suggest that the combination of elevated muscle PGC-1α and exercise constitutes a promising approach for the treatment of metabolic disorders.
22424117	Antioxidant and lipoxygenase inhibiting new iridoid glucosides from Caryopteris odorata.	The phytochemical investigation of the ethylacetate-soluble fraction of Caryopteris odorata (Ham. ex Roxb.) led to the isolation of four new iridoid glucosides (1-4): 8-O-trans-cinnamoyl caryoptoside (1), 8-O-trans-cinnamoyl shanzhiside methylester (2), 8-O-trans-cinnamoyl mussaenoside (3) and 8-O-cafeoyl massenoside (4). The structures of these compounds were determined by FAB-MS, IR, 1D and 2D-NMR spectroscopy and by comparing with the published data of the closely related compounds. The antioxidant potential of the isolated iridoids (1-4) was evaluated relative to conventionally used standards and these molecules exhibited good antioxidant potential. Moreover, their inhibitory potential was also screened against three enzymes, namely acetyl cholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and lipoxygenase. These iridoid glucosides were found to be inactive against acetyl and butyrylcholinesterases but active against lipoxygenase.
3917545	Inactivation of prostaglandin H synthase and prostacyclin synthase by phenylbutazone. Requirement for peroxidative metabolism.	Phenylbutazone (PB), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is an efficient reducing cofactor for the peroxidase activity of prostaglandin H synthase (PHS). Most reducing cofactors for the peroxidase protect PHS and prostacyclin synthase from inactivation by hydroperoxides. PB, however, does not protect these enzymes, but rather augments their hydroperoxide-dependent inactivation. Using ram seminal vesicle microsomes as a source of PHS and prostacyclin synthase, we have examined the interaction of PB and exogenous hydroperoxides. Chromatographic analysis of the metabolism of 14C-labeled arachidonic acid in this system revealed that PB-dependent inactivation of PHS is markedly increased in the presence of 100 microM H2O2. This inactivation is a linear function of PB concentration between 10 and 250 microM, with a half-maximal effect in this range at about 100 microM PB. Prostacyclin synthase is even more sensitive to inactivation by the combined PB and H2O2 treatment, with a corresponding half-maximal effect at PB concentrations near 25 microM. This PB- and H2O2-dependent inactivation is demonstrable whether PGH2 is generated in situ from arachidonic acid or is added exogenously, supporting a direct effect of the treatment on prostacyclin synthase. As PB undergoes peroxide-dependent co-oxygenation catalyzed by PHS, we propose that it is an oxygenated derivative of PB, rather than the parent compound, which is responsible for the inactivation of PHS and prostacyclin synthase. Nafazatrom, a competitive inhibitor of PB co-oxygenation, blocks the effects of the PB and H2O2 treatment, supporting our proposal.
7832763	Expression and selective inhibition of the constitutive and inducible forms of human cyclo-oxygenase.	The enzyme cyclo-oxygenase catalyses the oxygenation of arachidonic acid, leading to the formation of prostaglandins. Recently two forms of cyclo-oxygenase have been described: a constitutive (COX-1) enzyme present in most cells and tissues, and an inducible (COX-2) isoenzyme observed in many cells in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Constitutive and inducible forms of human cyclo-oxygenase (hCOX-1 and hCOX-2) were cloned and expressed in insect cells, utilizing a baculovirus expression system. hCOX-1 had a specific activity of 18.8 mumol of O2/mg with a Km of 13.8 microM for arachidonate and Vmax. of 1500 nmol of O2/nmol of enzyme, whereas hCOX-2 had a specific activity of 12.2 mumol of O2/mg with a Km of 8.7 microM for arachidonate and a Vmax. of 1090 nmol of O2/nmol of enzyme. Indomethacin inhibited both hCOX-1 and hCOX-2, whereas NS-398 and Dup-697 selectively inhibited hCOX-2. Both NS-398 and Dup-697 exhibited time-dependent inactivation of hCOX-2, as did indomethacin on both enzymes. The competitive inhibitor of hCOX-1, mefenamic acid, also displayed competitive inhibition of hCOX-2. These results demonstrate the ability to generate selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which could provide useful improvement therapeutically in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.
23386616	Toll-like receptor 2 mediates peripheral nerve injury-induced NADPH oxidase 2 expression in spinal cord microglia.	We have previously reported that NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) is up-regulated in spinal cord microglia after spinal nerve injury, demonstrating that it is critical for microglia activation and subsequent pain hypersensitivity. However, the mechanisms and molecules involved in Nox2 induction have not been elucidated. Previous studies have shown that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in nerve injury-induced spinal cord microglia activation. In this study, we investigated the role of TLR in Nox2 expression in spinal cord microglia after peripheral nerve injury. Studies using TLR knock-out mice have shown that nerve injury-induced microglial Nox2 up-regulation is abrogated in TLR2 but not in TLR3 or -4 knock-out mice. Intrathecal injection of lipoteichoic acid, a TLR2 agonist, induced Nox2 expression in spinal cord microglia both at the mRNA and protein levels. Similarly, lipoteichoic acid stimulation induced Nox2 expression and reactive oxygen species production in primary spinal cord glial cells in vitro. Studies on intracellular signaling pathways indicate that NF-κB and p38 MAP kinase activation is required for TLR2-induced Nox2 expression in glial cells. Conclusively, our data show that TLR2 mediates nerve injury-induced Nox2 gene expression in spinal cord microglia via NF-κB and p38 activation and thereby may contribute to spinal cord microglia activation.
17590520	Nicotine receptor gene CHRNA4 modulates early event-related potentials in auditory and visual oddball target detection tasks.	The present study seeks to identify effects of a common genetic polymorphism in the human nicotinic alpha4beta2 receptor on components of the cognitive event-related potentials in auditory and visual modalities. The same sense thymine-to-cytosine polymorphism (c.1629T-C; Ser543Ser) was shown to preferentially modulate early components in both modalities. Specifically, the auditory N1 component amplitude was higher for T allele homozygotes than for C allele carriers. The visual P1 component revealed the same pattern of significant polymorphic modulation, but the later N1 amplitude differences were only marginally significant. There was no reliable indication of interactions between genotype and task factors. Parallel modulation of early latency modality-specific event-related potential (ERP) components in vision and audition may indicate that the CHRNA4 polymorphism affects factors that are common to top-down modulation of sensory processing across modalities.
23416191	Fragment-based drug design and identification of HJC0123, a novel orally bioavailable STAT3 inhibitor for cancer therapy.	Fragment-based drug design (FBDD) is a promising approach for the generation of lead molecules with enhanced activity and especially drug-like properties against therapeutic targets. Herein, we report the fragment-based drug design, systematic chemical synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel scaffolds as potent anticancer agents by utilizing six privileged fragments from known STAT3 inhibitors. Several new molecules such as compounds 5, 12, and 19 that may act as advanced chemical leads have been identified. The most potent compound 5 (HJC0123) has demonstrated to inhibit STAT3 promoter activity, downregulate phosphorylation of STAT3, increase the expression of cleaved caspase-3, inhibit cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis in breast and pancreatic cancer cells with low micromolar to nanomolar IC50 values. Furthermore, compound 5 significantly suppressed estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor growth in vivo (p.o.), indicating its great potential as an efficacious and orally bioavailable drug candidate for human cancer therapy.
17069932	High-affinity GABA uptake and GABA-metabolizing enzymes in pig forebrain white matter: a quantitative study.	GABA receptor activation in central nervous white matter may be protective during white matter hypoxia in the adult, and it may modify axonal conduction, especially in the developing brain. GABA uptake is important for the shaping of the GABA signal, but quantitative data are lacking for GABA uptake and GABA-metabolizing enzymes in central nervous white matter. We report that high-affinity uptake of GABA in adult pig corpus callosum, fimbria, subcortical pyramidal tracts, and occipital white matter is approximately 20% of that in temporal cortex gray matter. Tiagabine (0.1 microM), an antiepileptic drug that specifically inhibits the GAT-1 GABA transporter inhibited GABA uptake 50% in temporal cortex and 60-68% in white structures. This finding indicates that GAT-1 is an important GABA transporter in white matter and suggests that white matter GABA uptake is inhibited during tiagabine therapy. GABA transaminase activity in white structures was approximately 20% of neocortical values. Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity in white structures was only 4% of that in neocortex (7-12 pmol/mg tissue x min(-1) versus approximately 200 pmol/mg tissue x min(-1)). Since white matter activity of citrate synthase of the tricarboxylic acid cycle was approximately 25% of neocortical values ( approximately 0.4 nmol/mg tissue x min(-1) versus approximately 1.5 nmol/mg tissue x min(-1)), the low GAD activity suggests a slower metabolic turnover of GABA in white than in gray matter.
14753499	Aquaporin-1 deletion reduces osmotic water permeability and cerebrospinal fluid production.	Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is a water channel that is strongly expressed at the ventricular-facing surface of choroid plexus epithelium. Using wildtype and AQP1 null mice, we developed novel methods to compare the water permeability in isolated choroid plexus, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production in living mice. Osmotically-induced water transport was rapid in freshly isolated choroid plexus from wildtype mice as measured by a spatial-filtering optical method, and reduced by 5-fold by AQP1 deletion. CSF production, an isosmolar fluid secretion process, was measured by a dye dilution method involving fluid collections using a second microneedle introduced into the cisterna magna. CSF production in wildtype mice was (in microl/min) 0.37 +/- 0.04 microl/min (control), 0.16 +/- 0.03 microl/min (acetazolamide-treated) and 1.14 +/- 0.15 microl/min (forskolin-treated), and reduced by up to 25% in AQP1 null mice. The impaired CSF production in AQP1 null mice provides direct functional evidence for the involvement of AQP1 in CSF formation.
17065073	Adenosine kinase from rat liver: new biochemical properties.	Adenosine kinase is a well-known enzyme which catalyzes the phosphorylation of adenosine to AMP: Its metabolic and kinetic properties are well studied. Here, we report new properties of rat liver enzyme, demonstrating a new reaction: ADP can be a phosphate donor instead ATP, according to the reaction: adenosine + ADP --> 2AMP) demonstrating the efficiency of AdK to phosphorylate adenosine, also starting from ADP. Cells could exploited this property in situations in which ATP levels are strongly decreased and ADP decreases slowly.
20517484	The role of rasagiline in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1% to 2% of people older than 60 years. Treatment of PD consists of symptomatic therapies while neuroprotective strategies have remained elusive. Rasagiline is a novel, potent, and irreversible monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor which has been approved for treatment of PD. Rasagiline inhibits MAO-B more potently than selegiline and has the advantage of once-daily dosing. In several large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, rasagiline has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in early PD and as adjunctive therapy in advanced PD. In addition, rasagiline has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in in vitro and in vivo studies. The recently completed delayed-start ADAGIO (Attenuation of Disease Progression with Azilect Given Once-daily) trial suggests a potential disease-modifying effect for rasagiline 1 mg/day, though the clinical import of this finding has yet to be established.
23216335	Platelet-derived microparticles in overweight/obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome.	A substantial proportion of women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are obese and obesity is considered as a prothrombotic state. Platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) might be implicated in the activation of the coagulation cascade. We aimed to assess plasma PMPs in overweight/obese women with PCOS. We measured plasma PMPs and determined anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal and ultrasonographic features of PCOS in 67 overweight/obese women with PCOS (with body mass index [BMI] >25.0 kg/m(2)) and in 21 BMI-matched healthy women. Circulating androgens and markers of insulin resistance (IR) were higher in women with PCOS than in controls. Plasma PMPs were also higher in women with PCOS than in controls (p = 0.046). In women with PCOS, plasma PMPs correlated with the mean number of follicles in the ovaries (r = 0.343; p = 0.006). In controls, plasma PMPs did not correlate with any of the studied parameters. In conclusion, plasma PMPs are elevated in overweight/obese women with PCOS compared with BMI-matched controls. The cause of this increase is unclear but both IR and hyperandrogenemia might be implicated. More studies are required to elucidate the pathogenesis of the elevation of PMPs in PCOS and to assess its implications on the cardiovascular risk of these patients.
17327402	Fatal hemorrhage in mice lacking gamma-glutamyl carboxylase.	The carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (gamma-carboxylase) is an essential posttranslational modification required for the biological activity of a number of proteins, including proteins involved in blood coagulation and its regulation. Heterozygous mice carrying a null mutation at the gamma-carboxylase (Ggcx) gene exhibit normal development and survival with no evidence of hemorrhage and normal functional activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, X, and prothrombin. Analysis of a Ggcx(+/-) intercross revealed a partial developmental block with only 50% of expected Ggcx(-/-) offspring surviving to term, with the latter animals dying uniformly at birth of massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This phenotype closely resembles the partial midembryonic loss and postnatal hemorrhage previously reported for both prothrombin- and factor V (F5)-deficient mice. These data exclude the existence of a redundant carboxylase pathway and suggest that functionally critical substrates for gamma-carboxylation, at least in the developing embryo and neonate, are primarily restricted to components of the blood coagulation cascade.
12826150	Calcineurin-free protocols with basiliximab induction allow patients included in "old to old" programs achieve standard kidney transplant function.	INTRODUCTION: The EuroTransplant "old to old" program establishes that patients older than 60 years can receive offers of organs from donors older than 60 years. The compromised function of these organs makes it a priority to preserve their initial kidney function. HYPOTHESIS: Calcineurin-sparing protocols using anti-IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) antibody induction (Simulect) may benefit initial kidney function in these patients, as assessed by the rates of delayed graft function and of rejection during the first month after transplant. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 15 consecutive elderly patients were prospectively compared with 30 cadaveric kidney transplants in younger recipients. Study patients were induced with Simulect (20 mg, 30 minutes before reperfusion and 4 days after transplantation) and steroids, delaying the introduction of CsA until the serum creatinine was below 3 mg/dL. The other cohort of patients were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus (trough 8 to 12), mycophenolats mofetil (MMF, 1 g/d), and an identical taper of steroids. The analysis compared donor and recipient ages, mean cold ischemic time, incidence of initial kidney function (diuresis in the first 24 h) serum creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), number of dialysis sessions, and rejection rate in the two groups. RESULTS: Except for the donor and recipient ages (72 vs 54 in donors, and 67 versus 52 years in recipients), no significant differences were observed between the groups among the rates of acute rejection (6.6% vs 13.2%), delayed graft function (13.2% required dialysis), or infection (6.6%). Within 1 month all 45 grafts showed primary function with equal creatinine levels (mean 1.65). CONCLUSIONS: Calcineurin-free protocols using IL-2 therapy as the initial suppression allow patients in the "old to old" ET program to display equal results to cadaveric kidney transplants with initial treatment with calcineurin antagonists.
23314046	Identification of novel antimycobacterial chemical agents through the in silico multi-conformational structure-based drug screening of a large-scale chemical library.	The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, which is resistant to effective multiple antibiotic, presents a major global health threat. The thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPK) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), which is an essential enzyme for the maintenance of the thymidine triphosphate pools, is considered an attractive target for the development of effective antibiotics against tuberculosis. In this study, we attempted to identify novel chemical compounds that specifically target the M. tuberculosis TMPK (mtTMPK). We performed in silico structure-based drug screening using the crystal structure data of mtTMPK and a large-scale virtual compound library, which is composed of 6,192,930 chemicals. Through a three-step screening method using the DOCK and GOLD, we identified ten chemical compounds that were predicted to have high binding affinity to the active site cleft of the mtTMPK. We then evaluated the antibiotic effects of these chemical compounds on model mycobacteria strains. As a result, we found that a chemical compound, K10, completely inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium vanbaalenii (M. vanbaalenii) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis). Moreover, K10 does not exhibit any toxic effects on the growth of enterobacteria and mammalian cells. The structural and experimental information regarding this novel chemical compound, K10, is likely to be useful for the hit-to-lead optimization of new antibiotics for the treatment of tuberculosis.
23401472	Epigenetic Regulation Is a Crucial Factor in the Repression of UGT1A1 Expression in the Human Kidney.	Human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 catalyzes the metabolism of numerous clinically and pharmacologically important compounds such as bilirubin and SN-38. UGT1A1 is predominantly expressed in the liver and intestine, but not in the kidney. The purpose of this study was to uncover the mechanism of the tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1, focusing on its epigenetic regulation. Bisulfite sequence analysis revealed that the CpG-rich region near the UGT1A1 promoter (-85 to +40) was hypermethylated (83%) in the kidney, whereas it was hypomethylated (37%) in the liver. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that histone H3 near the promoter was hypoacetylated in the kidney but was hyperacetylated in the liver; this hyperacetylation was accompanied by the recruitment of HNF1α to the promoter. The UGT1A1 promoter in human kidney-derived HK-2 cells that do not express UGT1A1 was fully methylated, but was relatively unmethylated in human liver-derived HuH-7 cells that express UGT1A1. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, resulted in an increase of UGT1A1 mRNA expression in both cell types, but the increase was much larger in HK-2 cells than in HuH-7 cells. The transfection of an HNF1α expression plasmid into the HK-2 cells resulted in an increase of UGT1A1 mRNA only in the presence of 5-Aza-dC. In summary, we found that DNA hypermethylation along with histone hypoacetylation interferes with the binding of HNF1α, resulting in the defective expression of UGT1A1 in the human kidney. Thus, epigenetic regulation is a crucial determinant of tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1.
23408116	The UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A Polymorphism c.2042C>G (rs8330) Is Associated with Increased Human Liver Acetaminophen Glucuronidation, Increased UGT1A Exon 5a/5b Splice Variant mRNA Ratio, and Decreased Risk of Unintentional Acetaminophen-Induced Acute Liver Failure.	Acetaminophen is cleared primarily by hepatic glucuronidation. Polymorphisms in genes encoding the acetaminophen UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes could explain interindividual variability in acetaminophen glucuronidation and variable risk for liver injury after acetaminophen overdose. In this study, human liver bank samples were phenotyped for acetaminophen glucuronidation activity and genotyped for the major acetaminophen-glucuronidating enzymes (UGTs 1A1, 1A6, 1A9, and 2B15). Of these, only three linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the shared UGT1A-3'UTR region (rs10929303, rs1042640, rs8330) were associated with acetaminophen glucuronidation activity, with rs8330 consistently showing higher acetaminophen glucuronidation at all the tested concentrations of acetaminophen. Mechanistic studies using luciferase-UGT1A-3'UTR reporters indicated that these SNPs do not alter mRNA stability or translation efficiency. However, there was evidence for allelic imbalance and a gene-dose proportional increase in the amount of exon 5a versus exon 5b containing UGT1A mRNA spliced transcripts in livers with the rs8330 variant allele. Cotransfection studies demonstrated an inhibitory effect of exon 5b containing cDNAs on acetaminophen glucuronidation by UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 cDNAs containing exon 5a. In silico analysis predicted that rs8330 creates an exon splice enhancer site that could favor exon 5a (over exon 5b) utilization during splicing. Finally, the prevalence of rs8330 was significantly lower (P = 0.027, χ(2) test) in patients who had acute liver failure from unintentional acetaminophen overdose compared with patients with acute liver failure from other causes or a race- or ethnicity-matched population. Together, these findings suggest that rs8330 is an important determinant of acetaminophen glucuronidation and could affect an individual's risk for acetaminophen-induced liver injury.
17603759	L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, a defect of metabolite repair.	L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a metabolic disorder in which L-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates as a result of a deficiency in FAD-linked L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme converting L-2-hydroxyglutarate to alpha-ketoglutarate. The origin of the L-2-hydroxyglutarate, which accumulates in this disorder, is presently unknown. The oxidation-reduction potential of the 2-hydroxyglutarate/alpha-ketoglutarate couple is such that L-2-hydroxyglutarate could potentially be produced through the reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate by a NAD- or NADP-linked oxidoreductase. In fractions of rat liver cytosolic extracts that had been chromatographed on an anion exchanger we detected an enzyme reducing alpha-ketoglutarate in the presence of NADH. This enzyme co-purified with cytosolic L-malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) upon further chromatography on Blue Sepharose. Mitochondrial fractions also contained an NADH-linked, 'alpha-ketoglutarate reductase', which similarly co-purified with mitochondrial L-malate dehydrogenase (mMDH). Purified mMDH catalysed the reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate to L-2-hydroxyglutarate with a catalytic efficiency that was about 10(7)-fold lower than that observed with oxaloacetate. For the cytosolic enzyme, this ratio amounted to 10(8), indicating that this enzyme is more specific. Both cMDH and mMDH are highly active in tissues and alpha-ketoglutarate is much more abundant than oxaloacetate and more concentrated in mitochondria than in the cytosol. As a result of this, the weak activity of mMDH on alpha-ketoglutarate is sufficient to account for the amount of L-2-hydroxyglutarate that is excreted by patients deficient in FAD-linked L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. The latter enzyme appears, therefore, to be responsible for a 'metabolite repair' phenomenon and to belong to the expanding class of 'house-cleaning' enzymes.
23386394	PHI: A powerful new program for the analysis of anisotropic monomeric and exchange-coupled polynuclear d- and f-block complexes.	A new program, PHI, with the ability to calculate the magnetic properties of large spin systems and complex orbitally degenerate systems, such as clusters of d-block and f-block ions, is presented. The program can intuitively fit experimental data from multiple sources, such as magnetic and spectroscopic data, simultaneously. PHI is extensively parallelized and can operate under the symmetric multiprocessing, single process multiple data, or GPU paradigms using a threaded, MPI or GPU model, respectively. For a given problem PHI is been shown to be almost 12 times faster than the well-known program MAGPACK, limited only by available hardware. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
23266270	Anti-inflammatory effects of trans-1,3-diphenyl-2,3-epoxypropane-1-one mediated by suppression of inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages.	To assess the potential therapeutic properties of trans-1,3-diphenyl-2,3-epoxypropane-1-one (DPEP), its anti-inflammatory effects were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells. DPEP induced dose-dependent reduction of the protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and concomitant reduction in the production of NO and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). Additionally, DPEP suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. We investigated the mechanism by which DPEP inhibits NO and PGE(2) by examining the level of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is an inflammation-induced signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 cells. DPEP inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38. Furthermore, DPEP inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation of inhibitor κB (IκB)-α and NF-κB p50. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that DPEP inhibits LPS-stimulated inflammation by blocking the NF-κB and MAPK pathways in macrophages.
23376608	Apigenin induces c-Myc-mediated apoptosis in FRO anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells.	Apigenin promotes apoptosis in cancer cells. We studied the effect of apigenin on cell survival and c-Myc expression in FRO anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) cells. Apigenin caused apoptosis via the elevation of c-Myc levels in conjunction with the phosphorylation of p38 and p53. In the c-Myc siRNA-transfected and apigenin-treated cells, compared with the apigenin-treated control cells, apoptosis and phosphorylation of p38 and p53 were ameliorated. In the presence of apigenin, diminution of p38 and p53 did not affect cell survival although apigenin activated the phosphorylation of p38 and p53 via increased c-Myc levels. In conclusion, our results indicate that apigenin induces apoptosis mediated via c-Myc with concomitant phosphorylation of p53 and p38 in FRO ATC cells. These findings suggest that augmented c-Myc acts as a core regulator and is necessary for apigenin-induced apoptosis in FRO ATC cells.
23122072	An improved mass spectrometric method for identification and quantification of phenolic compounds in apple fruits.	Thirty-nine phenolic compounds were analysed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with diode array and accurate mass spectrometry detection using electrospray ionisation (DAD/ESI-am-MS). Instrumental parameters such as scan speed, resolution, and mass accuracy were optimised to establish accurate mass measurements. The method was fully validated in terms of model deviation (r(2)>0.9990), range (typically 10-3500 ngg(-1)), intra/inter-day precision (<6% and <8%, respectively) and accuracy (typically 100 ± 10%). The mass accuracy of each selected phenolic compound was below 1.5 ppm. The results confirmed that the UHPLC-DAD/ESI-am-MS method developed here was convenient and reliable for the determination of phenolic compounds in apple extracts.
11246672	Minocycline inhibits the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase in articular chondrocytes.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the in vitro effects of tetracyclines and nonsteroidal antiiflammatory drugs on interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha) induced NO production and biosynthesis of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) by articular chondrocytes. METHODS: Bovine chondrocytes were cultured in alginate beads. Cells were treated with IL-lalpha in the presence or absence of drugs at various concentrations. Expression of mRNA for iNOS was analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-ELISA. Protein synthesis of iNOS was determined by immunoprecipitation. NO production was taken as a measure for the activity of the enzyme. RESULTS: Minocycline dose dependently reduced IL-1 stimulated NO production by inhibition of the mRNA expression (IC50 = 69.9 microM) and protein synthesis (IC50 = 37.11 microM) of iNOS. Diclofenac-Na at a concentration of 10 microM only weakly reduced nitrite accumulation and mRNA expression of iNOS. No effects were observed for tetracycline, doxycycline, and meloxicam. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of iNOS in articular chondrocytes may be a new mechanism by which minocycline could exert its beneficial effects in the treatment of joint diseases.
14500570	Minireview: malonyl CoA, AMP-activated protein kinase, and adiposity.	An increasing body of evidence has linked AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) to the regulation of energy balance. Thus, factors that activate AMPK and decrease the concentration of malonyl CoA in peripheral tissues, such as exercise, decrease triglyceride accumulation in the adipocyte and other cells. The data reviewed here suggest that this is related to the fact that these factors concurrently increase fatty acid oxidation, decrease the esterification of fatty acids to form glycerolipids, and, by mechanisms still unknown, increase energy expenditure. Malonyl CoA contributes to these events because it is an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, the enzyme that controls the transfer of long-chain fatty acyl CoA from the cytosol to the mitochondria, where they are oxidized. AMPK activation in turn increases fatty acid oxidation (by effects on enzymes that govern malonyl CoA synthesis and possibly its degradation) and inhibits triglyceride synthesis. It also increases the expression of uncoupling proteins and the transcriptional regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC1alpha), which could possibly increase energy expenditure. Recent studies suggest that the ability of leptin, adiponectin, 5'-aminoimidazole 4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), adrenergic agonists, and metformin to diminish adiposity may be mediated, at least in part, by AMPK activation in peripheral tissues. In addition, preliminary studies suggest that malonyl CoA and AMPK take part in fuel-sensing and signaling mechanisms in the hypothalamus that could regulate food intake and energy expenditure.
23215461	Recombinant human fibrinogen that produces thick fibrin fibers with increased wound adhesion and clot density.	Human fibrinogen is a biomaterial used in surgical tissue sealants, scaffolding for tissue engineering, and wound healing. Here we report on the post-translational structure and functionality of recombinant human FI (rFI) made at commodity levels in the milk of transgenic dairy cows. Relative to plasma-derived fibrinogen (pdFI), rFI predominately contained a simplified, neutral carbohydrate structure and >4-fold higher levels of the γ'-chain transcriptional variant that has been reported to bind thrombin and Factor XIII. In spite of these differences, rFI and pdFI were kinetically similar with respect to the thrombin-catalyzed formation of protofibrils and Factor XIIIa-mediated formation of cross-linked fibrin polymer. However, electron microscopy showed rFI produced fibrin with much thicker fibers with less branching than pdFI. In vivo studies in a swine liver transection model showed that, relative to pdFI, rFI made a denser, more strongly wound-adherent fibrin clot that more rapidly established hemostasis.
23382458	Characterization of efflux transporters involved in distribution and disposition of apixaban.	The studies reported here were conducted to investigate the transport characteristics of apixaban (1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7-oxo-6-(4-(2-oxopiperidin-1-yl)phenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-3-carboxamide) and to understand the impact of transporters on apixaban distribution and disposition. In human permeability glycoprotein (P-gp)- and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)-cDNA-transfected cell monolayers as well as Caco-2 cell monolayers, the apparent efflux ratio of basolateral-to-apical (PcB-A) versus apical-to-basolateral permeability (PcA-B) of apixaban was >10. The P-gp- and BCRP-facilitated transport of apixaban was concentration- and time-dependent and did not show saturation over a wide range of concentrations (1-100 μM). The efflux transport of apixaban was also demonstrated by the lower mucosal-to-serosal permeability than that of the serosal-to-mucosal direction in isolated rat jejunum segments. Apixaban did not inhibit digoxin transport in Caco-2 cells. Ketoconazole decreased the P-gp-mediated apixaban efflux in Caco-2 and the P-gp-cDNA-transfected cell monolayers, but did not affect the apixaban efflux to a meaningful extent in the BCRP-cDNA-transfected cell monolayers. Coincubation of a P-gp inhibitor (ketoconazole or cyclosporin A) and a BCRP inhibitor (Ko134) provided more complete inhibition of apixaban efflux in Caco-2 cells than separate inhibition by individual inhibitors. Naproxen inhibited apixaban efflux in Caco-2 cells but showed only a minimal effect on apixaban transport in the BCRP-transfected cells. Naproxen was the first nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that was demonstrated as a weak P-gp inhibitor. These results demonstrate that apixaban is a substrate for efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP, which can help explain its low brain penetration, and low fetal exposures and high milk excretion in rats.
3440035	Pharmacological properties of lorglumide as a member of a new class of cholecystokinin antagonists.	Derivatives of 5-(dipentylamino)-5-oxo-pentanoic acid are a new class of non-peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonists. The most potent compound, D,L-4-(3,4-dichlorobenzoylamino)-5-(dipentylamino)-5-oxo-pen tanoic acid (lorglumide, CR 1409), has a great affinity for the pancreatic CCK receptors and is a competitive, specific and potent CCK antagonist on the smooth muscles of the gall bladder and ileum of the guinea pig and on the CCK-induced amylase secretion of isolated pancreatic acini. In vivo lorglumide antagonizes the contraction of the gall bladder of the guinea pig and of the dog provoked by i.v. CCK-8 or ceruletide (caerulein). It antagonizes the satiety effect of CCK-8 in the rat and is protective against ceruletide-, taurocholate- and diet-induced pancreatitis. Lorglumide is therefore a useful pharmacological tool to study the functions of CCK. For its pharmacological properties, its relatively low toxicity and because it is active also after oral administration, lorglumide is a candidate for diagnostic or therapeutic use in man when an involvement of CCK is suspected.
23401473	Interaction of silymarin flavonolignans with organic anion-transporting polypeptides.	Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are multispecific transporters mediating the uptake of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics in tissues that are important for drug absorption and elimination, including the intestine and liver. Silymarin is a popular herbal supplement often used by patients with chronic liver disease; higher oral doses than those customarily used (140 mg three times/day) are being evaluated clinically. The present study examined the effect of silymarin flavonolignans on OATP1B1-, OATP1B3-, and OATP2B1-mediated transport in cell lines stably expressing these transporters and in human hepatocytes. In overexpressing cell lines, OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated estradiol-17β-glucuronide uptake and OATP2B1-mediated estrone-3-sulfate uptake were inhibited by most of the silymarin flavonolignans investigated. OATP1B1-, OATP1B3-, and OATP2B1-mediated substrate transport was inhibited efficiently by silymarin (IC50 values of 1.3, 2.2 and 0.3 µM, respectively), silybin A (IC50 values of 9.7, 2.7 and 4.5 µM, respectively), silybin B (IC50 values of 8.5, 5.0 and 0.8 µM, respectively), and silychristin (IC50 values of 9.0, 36.4, and 3.6 µM, respectively). Furthermore, silymarin, silybin A, and silybin B (100 µM) significantly inhibited OATP-mediated estradiol-17β-glucuronide and rosuvastatin uptake into human hepatocytes. Calculation of the maximal unbound portal vein concentrations/IC50 values indicated a low risk for silymarin-drug interactions in hepatic uptake with a customary silymarin dose. The extent of silymarin-drug interactions depends on OATP isoform specificity and concentrations of flavonolignans at the site of drug transport. Higher than customary doses of silymarin, or formulations with improved bioavailability, may increase the risk of flavonolignan interactions with OATP substrates in patients.
17436082	Prokinetic effects of a new ghrelin receptor agonist TZP-101 in a rat model of postoperative ileus.	Postoperative ileus (POI) is a major cause of postoperative complications and prolonged hospitalization. Ghrelin, which is the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, has been found to stimulate gastric motility and accelerate gastric emptying. The present study investigates whether TZP-101 (0.03-1 mg/kg i.v.), a synthetic ghrelin-receptor agonist, could improve gastrointestinal transit in rats with POI. Since the main factors for the development of POI are the surgical manipulation and the gastrointestinal effects of opioid-receptor agonists used for pain management, the effect of TZP-101 was investigated in rats subjected to surgery, to morphine treatment (3 mg/kg s.c.), or to a combination of both. The results showed that TZP-101 is equally effective against the delayed gastrointestinal transit induced by surgery, by morphine, or by the combination of both interventions. The prokinetic action of TZP-101 was more pronounced in the stomach compared to the small intestine.
23340651	Low oxygen tension maintains multipotency, whereas normoxia increases differentiation of mouse bone marrow stromal cells.	Optimization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) culture conditions is of great importance for their more successful application in regenerative medicine. O(2) regulates various aspects of cellular biology and, in vivo, MSC are exposed to different O(2) concentrations spanning from very low tension in the bone marrow niche, to higher amounts in wounds. In our present work, we isolated mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and showed that they contained a population meeting requirements for MSC definition. In order to establish the effect of low O(2) on cellular properties, we examined BSMC cultured under hypoxic (3% O(2)) conditions. Our results demonstrate that 3% O(2) augmented proliferation of BMSC, as well as the formation of colonies in the colony-forming unit assay (CFU-A), the percentage of quiescent cells, and the expression of stemness markers Rex-1 and Oct-4, thereby suggesting an increase in the stemness of culture when exposed to hypoxia. In contrast, intrinsic differentiation processes were inhibited by 3% O(2). Overall yield of differentiation was dependent on the adjustment of O(2) tension to the specific stage of BMSC culture. Thus, we established a strategy for efficient BMSC in vitro differentiation using an initial phase of cell propagation at 3% O(2), followed by differentiation stage at 21% O(2). We also demonstrated that 3% O(2) affected BMSC differentiation in p53 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) independent pathways. Our findings can significantly contribute to the obtaining of high-quality MSC for effective cell therapy.
23201622	High levels of ephrinB2 over-expression increases the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells and promotes enhanced cell mediated mineralisation in a polyethyleneimine-ephrinB2 gene-activated matrix.	Gene therapy can be combined with tissue engineering constructs to produce gene-activated matrices (GAMs) with enhanced capacity for repair. Polyethyleneimine (PEI), a non-viral vector, has previously been optimised for high efficiency gene transfer in rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs). The use of PEI to transfect human MSCs (hMSCs) with ephrinB2 is assessed here. Recently a role for the ephrinB2 ligand and EphB4 receptor duo has been proposed in bone remodelling. Herein, over-expression of the ephrinB2 ligand resulted in increased osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs. As ephrinB2 is a cell surface anchored ligand which only interacts with cells expressing the cognate EphB4 receptor through direct contact, we have shown that direct cell-cell contact between two neighbouring cells is responsible for enhanced osteogenesis. In an effort to begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms at play downstream of ephrinB2 over-expression, RT-PCR was performed on the GAMs which revealed no significant changes in runx2 or BMP2 expression but an upregulation of osterix (Osx) and Dlx5 expression prompting the belief that the mode of osteogenesis is independent of the BMP2 pathway. This select interaction, coupled with the transient gene expression profile of PEI, makes the PEI-ephrinB2 GAM an ideal candidate matrix for a bone targeted GAM.
17259370	Rosiglitazone inhibits acyl-CoA synthetase activity and fatty acid partitioning to diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-independent mechanism in human arterial smooth muscle cells and macrophages.	Rosiglitazone is an insulin-sensitizing agent that has recently been shown to exert beneficial effects on atherosclerosis. In addition to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, rosiglitazone can affect other targets, such as directly inhibiting recombinant long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL)-4 activity. Because it is unknown if ACSL4 is expressed in vascular cells involved in atherosclerosis, we investigated the ability of rosiglitazone to inhibit ACSL activity and fatty acid partitioning in human and murine arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and macrophages. Human and murine SMCs and human macrophages expressed Acsl4, and rosiglitazone inhibited Acsl activity in these cells. Furthermore, rosiglitazone acutely inhibited partitioning of fatty acids into phospholipids in human SMCs and inhibited fatty acid partitioning into diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol in human SMCs and macrophages through a PPAR-gamma-independent mechanism. Conversely, murine macrophages did not express ACSL4, and rosiglitazone did not inhibit ACSL activity in these cells, nor did it affect acute fatty acid partitioning into cellular lipids. Thus, rosiglitazone inhibits ACSL activity and fatty acid partitioning in human and murine SMCs and in human macrophages through a PPAR-gamma-independent mechanism likely to be mediated by ACSL4 inhibition. Therefore, rosiglitazone might alter the biological effects of fatty acids in these cells and in atherosclerosis.
23146838	Influence of ovarian and non-ovarian estrogens on weight gain in response to disruption of sweet taste--calorie relations in female rats.	Regulation of energy balance in female rats is known to differ along a number of dimensions compared to male rats. Previous work from our lab has demonstrated that in female rats fed dietary supplements containing high-intensity sweeteners that may disrupt a predictive relation between sweet tastes and calories, excess weight gain is demonstrated only when females are also fed a diet high in fat and sugar, and is evidenced primarily in animals already prone to gain excess weight. In contrast, male rats show excess weight gain when fed saccharin-sweetened yogurt supplements when fed both standard chow diets and diets high in fat and sugar, and regardless of their proneness to excess weight gain. The goal of the present experiments was to determine whether ovarian, or other sources of estrogens, contributes to the resistance to excess weight gain in female rats fed standard chow diets along with dietary supplements sweetened with yogurt. Results of the first experiment indicated that when the ovaries were removed surgically in adult female rats, patterns of weight gain were similar in animals fed saccharin-sweetened compared to glucose-sweetened yogurt supplements. In the second experiment, when the ovaries were surgically removed in adult female rats, and local production of estrogens was suppressed with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, females fed the saccharin-sweetened yogurt consumed more energy and gained more weight than females fed the glucose-sweetened yogurt. However, when the ovaries were surgically removed prior to the onset of puberty (at 24-25 days of age), females given saccharin-sweetened yogurt along with vehicle gained excess weight. In contrast, weight gain was similar in those given saccharin-sweetened and glucose-sweetened yogurt along with anastrozole. The results suggest that behavioral differences between males and females in response to disruption of sweet→calorie relations may result from differences in patterns of local estrogen production. These differences may be established developmentally during the pubertal period in females.
23333908	Hibiscus sabdariffa L. in the treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia: a comprehensive review of animal and human studies.	The effectiveness of Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (HS) in the treatment of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease is assessed in this review by taking a comprehensive approach to interpreting the randomized clinical trial (RCT) results in the context of the available ethnomedical, phytochemical, pharmacological, and safety and toxicity information. HS decoctions and infusions of calyxes, and on occasion leaves, are used in at least 10 countries worldwide in the treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia with no reported adverse events or side effects. HS extracts have a low degree of toxicity with a LD50 ranging from 2,000 to over 5,000mg/kg/day. There is no evidence of hepatic or renal toxicity as the result of HS extract consumption, except for possible adverse hepatic effects at high doses. There is evidence that HS acts as a diuretic, however in most cases the extract did not significantly influence electrolyte levels. Animal studies have consistently shown that consumption of HS extract reduces blood pressure in a dose dependent manner. In RCTs, the daily consumption of a tea or extract produced from HS calyxes significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in adults with pre to moderate essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes. In addition, HS tea was as effective at lowering blood pressure as the commonly used blood pressure medication Captropril, but less effective than Lisinopril. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides were lowered in the majority of normolipidemic, hyperlipidemic, and diabetic animal models, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was generally not affected by the consumption of HS extract. Over half of the RCTs showed that daily consumption of HS tea or extracts had favorable influence on lipid profiles including reduced total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, as well as increased HDL-C. Anthocyanins found in abundance in HS calyxes are generally considered the phytochemicals responsible for the antihypertensive and hypocholesterolemic effects, however evidence has also been provided for the role of polyphenols and hibiscus acid. A number of potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hypotensive and anticholesterol effects, but the most common explanation is the antioxidant effects of the anthocyanins inhibition of LDL-C oxidation, which impedes atherosclerosis, an important cardiovascular risk factor. This comprehensive body of evidence suggests that extracts of HS are promising as a treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, however more high quality animal and human studies informed by actual therapeutic practices are needed to provide recommendations for use that have the potential for widespread public health benefit.
23592595	An in Vivo Tagging Method Reveals that Ras Undergoes Sustained Activation upon Transglutaminase-Mediated Protein Serotonylation.	Don't interrupt! Protein serotonylation has been implicated in living cells, yet its role remains poorly defined because of the lack of characterization tools. We synthesized a serotonin derivative to enable selective tagging of serotonylation and to investigate its effect on Ras; the latter displayed undisrupted interaction with Raf-1 at the Ras binding domain.
8626538	Molecular cloning of a novel diacylglycerol kinase isozyme with a pleckstrin homology domain and a C-terminal tail similar to those of the EPH family of protein-tyrosine kinases.	A fourth member of the diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) gene family termed DGK delta was cloned from the human testis cDNA library. The cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 3,507 nucleotides encoding a putative DGK protein of 130,006 Da. Interestingly, the new DGK isozyme contains a pleckstrin homology domain found in a number of proteins involved in signal transduction. Furthermore, the C-terminal tail of this isozyme is very similar to those of the EPH family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The primary structure of the delta-isozyme also has two cysteine-rich zinc finger-like structures (C3 region) and the C-terminal C4 region, both of which have been commonly found in the three isozymes previously cloned (DGKs alpha, beta and gamma). However, DGK delta lacks the EF-hand motifs (C2) and contains a long Glu- and Ser-rich insertion (317 residues), which divides the C4 region into two portions. Taken together, these structural features of DGK delta indicate that this isozyme belongs to a DGK subfamily distinct from that consisting of DGKs alpha, beta, and gamma. Increased DGK activity without marked preference to arachidonoyl type of diacylglycerol was detected in the particulate fraction of COS-7 cells expressing the transfected DGKdelta cDNA. The enzyme activity was independent of phosphatidylserine, which is a common activator for the previously sequenced DGKs. Northern blot analysis showed that the DGK delta mRNA (approximately 6.3 kilobases) is most abundant in human skeletal muscle but undetectable in the brain, thymus, and retina. This expression pattern is different from those of the previously cloned DGKs. Our results show that the DGK gene family consists of at least two subfamilies consisting of enzymes with distinct structural characteristics and that each cell type probably expresses its own characteristic repertoire of DGKs whose functions may be regulated through different signal transduction pathways.
23386390	Add-on therapy with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin improves glycemic control in insulin-treated Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.	The effect of add-on therapy with sitagliptin on glycemic control was prospectively investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving insulin alone or insulin combined with oral antidiabetic drugs. Seventy-one patients were evaluated (38 men and 33 women aged 63.9±10.2 years). They were divided into three groups, which were 45 patients receiving premixed insulin twice daily, 15 patients receiving multiple daily insulin injections, and 11 patients receiving basal insulin with oral antidiabetic drugs (basal insulin therapy). Concomitant oral drugs included sulfonylureas, α-glucosidase inhibitors and metformin. The hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of all patients improved significantly from 8.1±1.2% to 7.6±1.1% after 12 weeks of add-on therapy with sitagliptin (p<0.01), and the insulin dosage was reduced from 27.3±15.8 U/day to 24.5±16.5 U/day (p<0.001). Body weight did not change after the start of concomitant therapy and severe hypoglycemia was not observed. The baseline HbA1c and glycated albumin levels were identified as factors that predicted the response to add-on therapy with sitagliptin. These findings suggest that add-on therapy with sitagliptin can be expected to achieve improvement of poor glycemic control irrespective of a patient's demographic profile. Stratified analysis based on the insulin regimen revealed a stronger antidiabetic effect and a high efficacy of sitagliptin when it was added to basal insulin therapy. The results of this investigation confirmed that add-on therapy with sitagliptin to various insulin regimens could improve glycemic control without severe hypoglycemia and/or weight gain.
18073378	Extended adjuvant therapy with anastrozole among postmenopausal breast cancer patients: results from the randomized Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial 6a.	BACKGROUND: Clinical trial data have shown that among breast cancer patients who were disease free after 5 years of adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, further extended treatment with the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor letrozole reduces breast cancer recurrence. We examined the efficacy and tolerability of extended adjuvant therapy with another aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, for 3 years among women who had completed 5 years of adjuvant therapy. METHODS: Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) Trial 6a is an extension of ABCSG Trial 6, in which hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal patients received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, with or without the aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide, for the first 2 years of therapy. For ABCSG Trial 6a, patients who were disease free at the end of Trial 6 were randomly assigned to receive either 3 years of anastrozole or no further treatment. Efficacy data were analyzed with the use of a Cox proportional hazards regression model with two-sided P values and Kaplan-Meier curves, and tolerability data were estimated using logistic regression analysis with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: ABCSG Trial 6a included 856 patients. At a median follow-up of 62.3 months, women who received anastrozole (n = 387) had a statistically significantly reduced risk of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, or distant metastasis) compared with women who received no further treatment (n = 469; hazard ratio = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.40 to 0.96, P = .031). Anastrozole was well tolerated, and no unexpected adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the benefit of extending adjuvant tamoxifen therapy beyond 5 years with anastrozole compared with no further treatment. Further research is required to define the optimum length of extended adjuvant therapy and to investigate the possibility of tailoring this period to suit different disease types.
17645691	Multiple protective effects of melatonin against maternal cholestasis-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the rat fetal liver-placenta-maternal liver trio.	Maternal cholestasis is usually a benign condition for the mother but induces profound placental damage and may be lethal for the fetus. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects in rat maternal and fetal livers as also the placenta of melatonin or silymarin against the oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by maternal obstructive cholestasis during the last third of pregnancy (OCP). Melatonin or silymarin administration (i.e. 5 mg/100 g bw/day after ligation of the maternal common bile duct on day 14 of pregnancy) reduced OCP-induced lipid peroxidation, and prevented decreases in total glutathione levels. However, the protective effect on OCP-induced impairment in the GSH/GSSG ratio was mild in the placenta and fetal liver, while absent in maternal liver. Melatonin or silymarin also reduced OCP-induced signs of apoptosis (increased caspase-3 activity and Bax-alpha upregulation) in all the organs assayed. Moreover, melatonin (but not silymarin) upregulated several proteins involved in the cellular protection against the oxidative stress in rats with OCP. These included, biliverdin-IX alpha reductase and the sodium-dependent vitamin C transport proteins SVCT1 and SVCT2, whose expression levels were enhanced in maternal and fetal liver by melatonin treatment. In contrast, in placenta only biliverdin-IX alpha reductase and SVCT2 were upregulated. These results indicate that whereas the treatment of cholestatic pregnant rats with melatonin or silymarin affords a direct protective antioxidant activity, only melatonin has dual beneficial effects against OCP-induced oxidative challenge in that it stimulates the expression of some components of the endogenous cellular antioxidant defense.
23063590	Artemisinic acid inhibits melanogenesis through downregulation of C/EBP α-dependent expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene.	Cholesterol is associated with the regulation of melanogenesis which is the major physiological defense against solar irradiation. The present study was designed to determine the effects of artemisinic acid on melanogenesis and its mechanisms of action in human epidermal melanocytes. In this study, we found that artemisinic acid inhibited melanin content. The mRNA levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and its downstream genes tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2 were reduced by artemisinic acid treatment. Additionally, the mRNA levels of melanogenesis-related genes (c-KIT, stem cell factor (SCF), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)) were down-regulated by artemisinic acid. Furthermore, cAMP production and protein kinase A (PKA) activity were suppressed by artemisinic acid. Moreover, attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the artemisinic acid-mediated effects revealed that artemisinic acid regulated melanogenesis by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis through downregulation of the hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase gene, which was mediated through reduced expression of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α gene. Taken together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by artemisinic acid occurs through reduced expression of the HMG CoA reductase gene, which is mediated by C/EBP α inhibition and suggest that artemisinic acid may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor.
23385219	Integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabonomics profiles in aflatoxin B1-induced hepatotoxicity in rat.	The aim of this work was to identify mechanisms and potential biomarkers for predicting the development and progression of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced acute hepatotoxicity. In this study, microarray analysis and metabolites profiles were used to identify shifts in gene expression and metabolite levels associated with the affected physiological processes of rats treated with AFB1. Histopathological examinations and serum biochemical analysis were simultaneously performed; the results indicated that hepatotoxicity occurred in higher dosage groups. However, gene expression analysis and metabolite profiles are more sensitive than general toxicity studies for detecting AFB1-induced acute hepatotoxicity as the patterns of low-dose AFB1-treated rats in these two technique platforms were more similar to the rats in higher dosage groups than to the control rats. Integrated analysis of the results from general toxicity studies, transcriptomics and metabonomics profiles suggested that p53 signaling pathway induced by oxidative damage was the crucial step in AFB1-induced acute hepatotoxicity, whereas gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism disorder were found to be the major metabolic effects after acute AFB1 exposure. The genes and metabolites significantly affected in common in rat liver or serum of three doses AFB1 treatments served as potential biomarkers for detecting AFB1-induced acute hepatotoxicity.
17352828	A pilot study of IL-1 inhibition by anakinra in acute gout.	Monosodium urate crystals stimulate monocytes and macrophages to release IL-1beta through the NALP3 component of the inflammasome. The effectiveness of IL-1 inhibition in hereditary autoinflammatory syndromes with mutations in the NALP3 protein suggested that IL-1 inhibition might also be effective in relieving the inflammatory manifestations of acute gout. The effectiveness of IL-1 inhibition was first evaluated in a mouse model of monosodium urate crystal-induced inflammation. IL-1 inhibition prevented peritoneal neutrophil accumulation but TNF blockade had no effect. Based on these findings, we performed a pilot, open-labeled study (trial registration number ISRCTN10862635) in 10 patients with gout who could not tolerate or had failed standard antiinflammatory therapies. All patients received 100 mg anakinra daily for 3 days. All 10 patients with acute gout responded rapidly to anakinra. No adverse effects were observed. IL-1 blockade appears to be an effective therapy for acute gouty arthritis. The clinical findings need to be confirmed in a controlled study.
7601910	Altered gene expression in murine branchial arches following in utero exposure to retinoic acid.	Retinoic acid (RA) in the form of isotretinoin (Accutane) and tretinoin (Retin-A) is a clinically important compound in the treatment of dermatologic disorders. However, it is also a potent teratogen associated with a number of serious congenital malformations. Generally, these malformations involve the craniofacial structures derived from the first and second branchial arches. To determine how altered gene expression may contribute to the observed RA-induced defects, pregnant LM/Bc mice were administered (5 mg/kg) all-trans RA on gestational day (GD) 8:12. First and second branchial arches were removed from control and teratogen-treated embryos on GD 10:00 10:12, or 12:00, processed by in situ transcription/aRNA techniques, and analyzed for alterations in gene expression. In these studies, a panel of 40 candidate genes that are known to be important in mammalian craniofacial development were examined. This analysis revealed significant differences in the expression level of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha (NAChR), transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF beta 2), type 1 cellular retinoid binding protein (CRBP-1), retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR gamma), and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). The alterations observed in the expression of these genes following RA exposure may prohibit normal morphogenetic processes within the second branchial arch and lead to the observed malformations.
6150080	Amine oxidase activities in brown adipose tissue of the rat: identification of semicarbazide-sensitive (clorgyline-resistant) activity at the fat cell membrane.	Amine oxidase activity, previously described in homogenates of brown adipose tissue of the rat, has now been investigated in preparations of isolated fat cells. It was found that the specific activities of both monoamine oxidase A (MAO) and of the semicarbazide-sensitive clorgyline-resistant amine oxidase (SSAO) were higher in isolated fat cells than in the original whole tissue. Brown adipocytes therefore represent a major source of both these enzymes. In plasma membranes prepared from these isolated brown fat cells by borate extraction there was a similar enrichment of activity of SSAO and of the plasma membrane marker enzyme, phosphodiesterase I. However in preparations of cell membranes made by binding the cells to polycation-coated beads, enrichment of phosphodiesterase I activity was much greater than that of SSAO. It is suggested that the disposition of the enzyme within the cell membrane may account for the discrepancy in these results, i.e. the sidedness of the membrane may be important. Histochemical visualization of enzyme activity in whole tissue at the ultrastructural level was undertaken. Positive staining of mitochondria was achieved in the presence of the MAO substrate, tryptamine. Staining around the edges of the brown fat cells was observed with the SSAO substrates, tyramine and benzylamine. Staining was largely absent when substrate was omitted or after pretreatment with the irreversible SSAO inhibitor, hydralazine and the slowly reversible inhibitor, semicarbazide. It is not definitely proven that this staining represents sites of enzyme activity but the results are consistent with evidence from other studies indicating that SSAO in brown adipose tissue of the rat may be found predominantly at the fat cell surface.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
15639300	Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) act by increasing intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP, which has a broad range of anti-inflammatory effects on various key effector cells involved in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The therapeutic ratio for PDE4 inhibitors is thought to be determined by selectivity on receptor subtypes for relative effects on PDE4B (anti-inflammatory) and PDE4D (emesis). The two main orally active PDE4 inhibitors in the late phase III of clinical development are cilomilast and roflumilast; the latter (and its active metabolite N-oxide) is more selective and potent with a superior therapeutic ratio. Studies on cilomilast in COPD based on bronchial biopsy material have shown a broad range of anti-inflammatory activity, and the available evidence on clinical outcomes for up to 6 months with cilomilast 15 mg twice daily and roflumilast 500 mug once daily have shown variable but significant effects on exacerbations and quality of life, with small improvements in measures of pulmonary function. Roflumilast has a better safety and tolerability profile than cilomilast, with the main adverse effects being nausea, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain. Roflumilast also has activity in asthma as assessed by its attenuation of allergen and exercise challenges, and it shows clinical efficacy equivalent to that of beclomethasone dipropionate 400 mug daily. The emerging results of clinical trials on PDE4 inhibitors in asthma and COPD should be interpreted with cautious optimism since much of the evidence has been published only in abstract form to date. The next few years should resolve important issues about the potential role of these drugs as oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma and COPD and their place in management guidelines. Ultimately, clinicians will want to know whether PDE4 inhibitors are anything more than expensive "designer" theophylline, the archetypal non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor.
23416065	Human serum albumin-based design of a diflunisal prodrug.	The cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, diflunisal, is used in the clinic for its anti-inflammatory activity. About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.
23298292	A design of experiments to optimize a new manufacturing process for high activity protein-containing submicron particles.	A novel method for the manufacture of protein/peptide-containing submicron particles was developed in an attempt to provide particles with increased activity while using high energy input technologies. The method consists of antisolvent co-precipitation from an aqueous solution containing both an amino acid core material (e.g. D,L-valine), and either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or lysozyme (Lys) as model proteins. The aqueous solution was added to the organic phase by means of a nebulizer to increase the total surface area of interaction for the precipitation process. Sonication proved to be an effective method to produce small particle sizes while maintaining high activity of Lys. The use of a polysorbate or sorbitan ester derivatives as stabilizers proved to be necessary to yield submicron particles. Particles with very high yields (approximately 100%) and very high activity after manufacture (approximately 100%) could be obtained. A particle size of 439.0 nm, with a yield of 48.8% and with final remaining activity of98.7% was obtained. By studying various factors using a design of experiments strategy (DoE) we were able to establish the critical controlling factors for this new method of manufacture.
16609060	Chemotherapy and targeted therapy combinations in advanced melanoma.	For three decades, clinical trials with chemotherapy in melanoma have failed to show superiority of any one regimen over another. Dacarbazine remains the only "standard" agent. With response rates of <10% and median progression-free survival of 2 months or less in contemporary trials, there is a need to improve systemic therapy. Combination chemotherapy is associated with higher response rates than single-agent therapy but this has not translated into improved survival. An increasing number of potential therapeutic targets have been identified. For some, pharmacologic inhibitors are available, including sorafenib for BRAF, farnesyltransferase inhibitors for NRAS, PD-0325901 for mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, rapamycin analogues for mammalian target of rapamycin, and agents that inhibit either vascular endothelial growth factor or its receptors. Several multitargeted kinase inhibitors have potency against the fibroblast growth factor receptor, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Small-molecule inhibitors of c-met and Akt are in preclinical development. Another class of agents indirectly affect aberrant signaling, including inhibitors of chaperones and proteasomes. Several targeted agents seem to enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in preclinical models. The mechanism by which signaling inhibition might synergize with chemotherapy requires more study so that rational combinations move forward. Very few targeted agents have been studied rigorously in this fashion.
15070163	Effects of an ethanolic salix extract on the release of selected inflammatory mediators in vitro.	Salix extracts are in current use for the treatment of pain and inflammation. In order to obtain an insight into the mechanism(s) of action of the ethanolic Salix extract 1520L--which is essentially similar to an extract for which clinical studies have demonstrated analgesic effectiveness--its effects were evaluated in an established in vitro assay test system using primary human monocytes. The IC50-values obtained for the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) reflecting cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-mediated PGE2 release were 47 microg/ml and 0.6 microg/ml, for the Salix extract 1520L and rofecoxib-like research compound L745337, respectively. There was no effect on COX-1 and COX-2 activity. The Salix extract inhibited the LPS-induced release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6 with IC50-values of 180.0, 33.0 and 86.0 microg/ml, respectively. Both, salicin and salicylate, had no effect in any of the parameters. Our results indicate that Salix extract 1520L inhibits COX-2-mediated PGE2 release through compounds other than salicin or salicylate. Our data further suggest that the proprietary Salix extract is a weak inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokines.
22859660	Effects of fenofibrate, a PPAR-α ligand, on the haemodynamics of glycerol-induced renal failure in rats.	The modulating effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α ligand on haemodynamic effects of phenylepherine (PE), angiotensin II (AII), endothelin 1 (ET1), acetylcholine (Ach), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and isoproterenol (ISO) were evaluated in glycerol-induced acute kidney injury in rats. The effect of PE on fenofibrate-treated animals was a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). For AII and ET1, MAP was also increased for the fenofibrate group but not in a dose-dependent fashion. On the medullary blood flow (MBF), while the lower doses of PE and AII increased the perfusion unit on the fenofibrate-treated group, the higher doses decreased the perfusion unit. The ET1 increased the perfusion unit on this group but not in dose-dependent fashion. The effects of PE and AII on the cortical blood flow (CBF) of fenofibrate-treated group is similar to that of MBF for the same group but not for ET1. The effect of Ach, SNP and ISO in all the groups was the decrease in MAP. ISO caused dose-dependent increase in MBF of fenofibrate-treated group. The effect of Ach, SNP and ISO on the CBF perfusion unit was that of the increase for the fenofibrate-treated group. The study showed that fenofibrate did not attenuate increased blood pressure induced by PE, AII and ET1 but caused enhanced vasodilation by Ach, SNP and ISO.
9669506	Affinities of venlafaxine and various reuptake inhibitors for the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters.	In vitro radioligand binding studies were carried out in rat brain membranes to assess the affinity of various reuptake inhibitors for the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and the norepinephrine transporters using the selective ligands [3H]cyanoimipramine and [3H]nisoxetine, respectively. The selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors paroxetine, indalpine and fluvoxamine displayed a high affinity for the 5-HT transporter, whereas the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desipramine had a high affinity for the norepinephrine transporter. Duloxetine, a dual 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, displayed a high affinity for both the 5-HT and the norepinephrine transporters. Interestingly, venlafaxine, a dual 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, displayed only a moderate affinity for the 5-HT transporter (Ki = 74 nM) and a very low affinity for the norepinephrine transporter (Ki = 1.26 microM). The relatively low affinities of venlafaxine contrast with its potent in vivo 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake blocking properties. These results raise the possibility that the in vivo effects on the 5-HT and norepinephrine reuptake observed with venlafaxine may not be mediated solely by its binding to the [3H]cyanoimipramine and [3H]nisoxetine binding sites.
16303771	Tissue-type plasminogen activator acts as a cytokine that triggers intracellular signal transduction and induces matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene expression.	Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), a serine protease well known for generating plasmin, has been demonstrated to induce matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene expression and protein secretion in renal interstitial fibroblasts. However, exactly how tPA transduces its signal into the nucleus to control gene expression is unknown. This study investigated the mechanism by which tPA induces MMP-9 gene expression. Both wild-type and non-enzymatic mutant tPA were found to induce MMP-9 expression in rat kidney interstitial fibroblasts (NRK-49F), indicating that the actions of tPA are independent of its proteolytic activity. tPA bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) in NRK-49F cells, and this binding was competitively abrogated by the LRP-1 antagonist, the receptor-associated protein. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PEA-13) lacking LRP-1, tPA failed to induce MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, tPA induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation on the beta subunit of LRP-1, which was followed by the activation of Mek1 and its downstream Erk-1 and -2. Blockade of Erk-1/2 activation by the Mek1 inhibitor abolished MMP-9 induction by tPA in NRK-49F cells. Conversely, overexpression of constitutively activated Mek1 induced Erk-1/2 phosphorylation and MMP-9 expression. In mouse obstructed kidney, tPA, LRP-1, and MMP-9 were concomitantly induced in the renal interstitium. Collectively, these results suggest that besides its classical proteolytic activity, tPA acts as a cytokine that binds to the cell membrane receptor LRP-1, induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, and triggers intracellular signal transduction, thereby inducing specific gene expression in renal interstitial fibroblasts.
23334403	Almorexant effects on CYP3A4 activity studied by its simultaneous and time-separated administration with simvastatin and atorvastatin.	PURPOSE: To characterise further the previously observed cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) interaction of the dual orexin receptor antagonist almorexant. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic interactions were investigated (n = 14 healthy male subjects in two treatment groups) between almorexant at steady-state when administered either concomitantly or 2 h after administration of single doses of simvastatin (40 mg) or atorvastatin (40 mg). RESULTS: Almorexant dose-dependently increased simvastatin exposure (AUC(0-∞)) when administered concomitantly [geometric mean ratios (90 % CI): 2.5 (2.1, 2.9) (100 mg), 3.9 (3.3, 4.6) (200 mg)], but not C(max) [3.7 (3.0, 4.5) for both doses]. Time-separated administration resulted in relevant reductions of the interaction [AUC(0-∞): 1.4 (1.2, 1.7) (100 mg), 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) (200 mg); C(max): 1.5 (1.3, 1.9) (100 mg), 1.9 (1.6, 2.4) (200 mg)]. Similar results were obtained for hydroxyacid simvastatin. Independent of almorexant dose and relative time of administration, AUC(0-∞) and C(max) of atorvastatin increased (ratios ranged from 1.1 to 1.5). AUC(0-∞) and C(max) of o-hydroxy atorvastatin decreased dose-independently [AUC(0-∞): 0.8 (0.8, 0.9) (100 mg), 0.6 (0.5, 0.6) (200 mg); C(max): 0.3 (0.3, 0.4) (100 mg), 0.2 (0.2, 0.3) (200 mg)] when atorvastatin was concomitantly administered. C(max) of o-hydroxy atorvastatin slightly decreased (0.8 for both doses) following time-separated administration; AUC(0-∞) was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas almorexant increased simvastatin exposure dose- and relative time of administration-dependently, atorvastatin exposure increased to a smaller extent and irrespective of dose and time. This suggests that the observed interaction of almorexant with simvastatin is mainly caused by intestinal CYP3A4 inhibition, whereas the interaction with atorvastatin is more due to hepatic CYP3A4 inhibition.
10978228	A gene for pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy maps to chromosome 5q31.	Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized seizures in the first hours of life and responding only to pyridoxine hydrochloride. The pathogenesis of PDE is unknown, but an alteration in the binding of pyridoxal 5-phosphate to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) has been postulated in patients with PDE. Results are reported for genetic linkage analyses in four families with consanguineous parents and in one family with nonconsanguineous parents. The GAD1 (2q31) and GAD2 genes (10p23) were tested and excluded. A genomewide search was subsequently performed, using microsatellite markers at an average distance of 10 cM, and the search revealed linkage of the disease-causing gene to markers on chromosome 5q31.2-q31.3 (maximum LOD score [Z(max)] 8.43 at recombination fraction [theta] 0 and Zmax=7.58 at straight theta=0 at loci D5S2017 and D5S1972, respectively). A recombination event, between loci D5S638 and D5S463, in one family defined the distal boundary, and a second recombination event between loci D5S2011 and D5S2017 in another family defined the proximal boundary of the genetic interval encompassing the PDE gene (5.1 cM). Ongoing studies may lead to the identification of the disease-causing gene.
23603058	The Fusarium toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) modulates the LPS induced acute phase reaction in pigs.	The systemic effects of the Fusarium toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) and of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were studied in male castrated pigs (40.4±3.7kg) infused intravenously with either DON or LPS alone (100μgDON/kg/h, 7.5μg/LPS/kg/h), or together (100μgDON plus 7.5μg/LPS/kg/h). The Control group received a saline infusion (n=6/treatment, 24h observation period). An additional DON infusion did not exacerbate the clinical signs observed in LPS-infused pigs. For example, rectal temperature climaxed after 4h (40.4±0.2°C) and 5h (40.1±0.3°C), in the LPS and LPS+DON groups, respectively. Saline and DON alone did not induce an acute phase reaction as indicated by unaltered plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) while LPS caused a significant rise of both cytokines. TNF-alpha plasma peak concentrations were significantly higher in the LPS compared to the DON+LPS group (94.3±17.2ng/mL vs. 79.2±15.7ng/mL) while IL-6 climaxed earlier in the latter group (3h p.i. vs. 2h p.i.). From the tested clinical-chemical plasma characteristics the total bilirubin concentration and the ASAT activity were strongly elevated by the LPS infusion and additionally increased and decreased by DON, respectively. In conclusion, the LPS-induced effects were only marginally modified by DON.
1665782	Chronic effect of [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin on rat brain opioid receptors.	In previous studies, we have demonstrated that chronic etorphine or [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE) treatment of rats results in the reduction of mu- and delta-opioid receptor binding activities as tolerance develops. As both etorphine and DADLE are relatively non-specific opioid ligands, interacting with both mu- and delta-receptors, these studies could not determine whether down-regulation of a specific receptor type occurs. Therefore, in the present studies, animals were rendered tolerant to the delta-opioid receptor-selective agonist [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE), and receptor binding activities were measured. Treating Sprague-Dawley rats with increasing doses of DPDPE (80-160-240-320 micrograms/kg) i.c.v. for 1 to 4 days resulted in a time-dependent increase in the AD50 of DPDPE to elicit an antinociceptive response. When delta-receptor binding was determined by using [3H]DPDPE, a 40-50% decrease in binding in the midbrain and cortex, and 25-35% decrease in binding in the striatum were observed after 3 or 4 days of DPDPE treatment. Scatchard analysis of the [3H]DPDPE saturation binding data revealed a decrease in Bmax values and no significant change in Kd values. To our surprise, when mu-receptor binding was determined by using [3H]Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol (DAMGO), a 10-15% decrease in binding was also observed in the midbrain and cortex after 4 days of DPDPE treatment. Our conclusion is that chronic DPDPE treatment preferentially reduces delta-opioid receptor binding activity. Its minor effect on the mu-opioid receptor maybe due to an interaction between delta cx and mu cx binding sites.
23260346	Selective inhibitors and tailored activity probes for lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2).	Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2) or PLA(2)G7) binds to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, where it is thought to hydrolyze oxidatively truncated phospholipids. Lp-PLA(2) has also been implicated as a pro-tumorigenic enzyme in human prostate cancer. Several inhibitors of Lp-PLA(2) have been described, including darapladib, which is currently in phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The selectivity that darapladib and other Lp-PLA(2) inhibitors display across the larger serine hydrolase family has not, however, been reported. Here, we describe the use of both general and tailored activity-based probes for profiling Lp-PLA(2) and inhibitors of this enzyme in native biological systems. We show that both darapladib and a novel class of structurally distinct carbamate inhibitors inactivate Lp-PLA(2) in mouse tissues and human cell lines with high selectivity. Our findings thus identify both inhibitors and chemoproteomic probes that are suitable for investigating Lp-PLA(2) function in biological systems.
23261715	Modulation of activity and inhibitor sensitivity of rabbit aldose reductase-like protein (AKR1B19) by oxidized glutathione and SH-reagents.	Rabbit aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1B19 is an ortholog of human aldose reductase-like protein (ARLP), AKR1B10, showing 86% amino acid sequence identity. AKR1B19 exhibits the highest catalytic efficiency for 4-oxo-2-nonenal, a major product of lipid peroxidation, compared to known reductases of this aldehyde. In this study, we found that the reductase activity of AKR1B19 was activated to about 5-fold immediately after the addition of 10 μM SH-reagents (p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid) in the absence or presence of NADPH. In addition, a maximum of 3-fold activation of AKR1B19 was induced by incubation with glutathione disulfide (GSSG) for 1h. The activated enzyme was converted into the native enzyme by further incubation with dithiothreitol and glutathione. The activation was abolished by the C299S mutation of AKR1B19, and the glutathionylated Cys299 was identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The Cys299-modified enzyme displayed different kinetic alterations depending on substrates and inhibitors. In the reduction of 4-oxo-2-nonenal, the catalytic efficiency was increased. Thus, AKR1B10 may be modulated by cellular ratio of GSSG/glutathione and more efficiently act as a detoxifying enzyme for the cytotoxic aldehyde under oxidatively stressed conditions. Furthermore, such an activity alteration by GSSG was not detected in AKR1B10 and rat ARLPs, suggesting the presence of a GSSG-binding site near Cys299 in AKR1B19.
9399970	Discriminative stimulus effects of the mixed-opioid agonist/antagonist dezocine: cross-substitution by mu and delta opioid agonists.	The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the discriminative stimulus effects of the mixed-opioid agonist/antagonist dezocine. In pigeons trained to discriminate 1.7 mg/kg dezocine from saline, a series of opioids with activity at the mu opioid receptor substituted completely for the dezocine stimulus with a rank order of potency similar to that obtained in other assays sensitive to the effects of mu agonists (i.e., fentanyl >[-]-cyclazocine >buprenorphine = butorphanol >l-methadone >nalbuphine >[-]-metazocine >morphine). (-)-N-allylnormetazocine and (+)-propoxyphene substituted partially for the dezocine stimulus, an effect obtained even when tested up to doses that suppressed responding. Naloxone (0.1 - 10 mg/kg) antagonized the stimulus effects of dezocine, (+)-propoxyphene and fentanyl in a dose-related manner, whereas doses of naloxone that antagonized fentanyl's rate-decreasing effects failed to antagonize the rate-decreasing effects of dezocine and (+)-propoxyphene. A 10-mg/kg dose of the mu-selective, noncompetitive antagonist beta-funaltrexamine was more effective against the stimulus effects of dezocine and nalbuphine than against morphine and fentanyl. As was observed with naloxone, beta-funaltrexamine failed to antagonize dezocine's rate-decreasing effects. The delta agonists BW373U86 and SNC80 substituted partially for the dezocine stimulus, and these effects were reversed by doses of the delta-selective antagonist naltrindole (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) that had no effect on the dezocine stimulus. Naltrindole also antagonized the rate-decreasing effects produced by BW373U86 and SNC80, but not those of dezocine. The kappa agonists bremazocine, spiradoline, U50,488 and U69,593 failed to substitute for the dezocine stimulus. The kappa-selective antagonist norbinaltorphimine (1.0 mg/kg) failed to antagonize dezocine's stimulus or rate-decreasing effects. The present findings indicate that dezocine shares similar stimulus effects with both mu and delta agonists, its stimulus effects are reversed by mu-selective antagonists, and its rate-decreasing effects are not mediated by activity at mu, kappa or delta opioid receptors.
23254196	Phytoestrogen genistein protects against endothelial barrier dysfunction in vascular endothelial cells through PKA-mediated suppression of RhoA signaling.	The soy-derived phytoestrogen genistein has received attention for its potential to improve vascular function, but its mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that genistein at physiologically relevant concentrations (0.1-10 μM) significantly inhibited thrombin-induced increase in endothelial monolayer permeability. Genistein also reduced the formation of stress fibers by thrombin and suppressed thrombin-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) on Ser(19)/Thr(18) in endothelial cells (ECs). Genistein had no effect on resting intracellular [Ca(2+)] or thrombin-induced increase in Ca(2+) mobilization. Addition of the inhibitors of endothelial nitric oxide synthase or estrogen receptor did not alter the protective effect of genistein. RhoA is a small GTPase that plays an important role in actin-myosin contraction and endothelial barrier dysfunction. RhoA inhibitor blocked the protective effect of genistein on endothelial permeability and also ablated thrombin-induced MLC-phosphorylation in ECs. Inhibition of PKA significantly attenuated the effect of genistein on thrombin-induced EC permeability, MLC phosphorylation, and RhoA membrane translocation in ECs. Furthermore, thrombin diminished cAMP production in ECs, which were prevented by treatment with genistein. These findings demonstrated that genistein improves thrombin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in ECs through PKA-mediated suppression of RhoA signaling.
17325243	Identification of a novel polymorphism in the 3'UTR of the L-arginine transporter gene SLC7A1: contribution to hypertension and endothelial dysfunction.	BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction because of reduced nitric oxide bioavailability is a key feature of essential hypertension. We have found that normotensive siblings of subjects with essential hypertension have impaired endothelial function accompanied by altered arginine metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have identified a novel C/T polymorphism in the 3'UTR of the principal arginine transporter, solute carrier family 7 (cationic amino acid transporter, y+ system), member 1 gene (SLC7A1). The minor T allele significantly attenuates reporter gene expression (P<0.01) and is impaired in its capacity to form DNA-protein complexes (P<0.05). In 278 hypertensive subjects the frequency of the T allele was 13.3% compared with 7.6% in 498 normotensive subjects (P<0.001). Moreover, the overall genotype distribution observed in hypertensives differed significantly from that in normotensives (P<0.001). To complement these studies, we generated an endothelial-specific transgenic mouse overexpressing L-arginine transporter SLC7A1. The Slc7A1 transgenic mice exhibited significantly enhanced responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (-log EC50 for wild-type versus Slc7A1 transgenic: 6.87+/-0.10 versus 7.56+/-0.13; P<0.001). This was accompanied by elevated production of nitric oxide by isolated aortic endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identifies a key, functionally active polymorphism in the 3'UTR of SLC7A1. As such, this polymorphism may account for the apparent link between altered endothelial function, L-arginine, and nitric oxide metabolism and predisposition to essential hypertension.
23265905	Design and synthesis of novel 2-methyl-4,5-substitutedbenzo[f]-3,3a,4,5-tetrahydro-pyrazolo[1,5-d][1,4]oxazepin-8(7H)-one derivatives as telomerase inhibitors.	Eight novel 4,5-tetrahydropyrazolo[1,5-d][1,4]oxazepine derivatives have been synthesized and purified to be screened for anticancer activity. By a modified TRAP assay, some titled compounds were tested against telomerase, and compound 4a showed the most potent inhibitory activity with IC(50) value at 0.78 ± 0.22 μM. Western blot assays showed that compounds 4a and 4b could inhibit expression of Cyclin D1, TERT, phospho-AKT and PI3K/AKT pathway.
17184764	Retinoids control anterior and dorsal properties in the developing forebrain.	We have previously shown that retinoic acid (RA) synthesized by the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) is required in forebrain development. Deficiency in RA due to inactivation of the mouse Raldh2 gene or to complete absence of retinoids in vitamin-A-deficient (VAD) quails, leads to abnormal morphogenesis of various forebrain derivatives. In this study we show that double Raldh2/Raldh3 mouse mutants have a more severe phenotype in the craniofacial region than single null mutants. In particular, the nasal processes are truncated and the eye abnormalities are exacerbated. It has been previously shown that retinoids act mainly on cell proliferation and survival in the ventral forebrain by regulating SHH and FGF8 signaling. Using the VAD quail model, which survives longer than the Raldh-deficient mouse embryos, we found that retinoids act in maintaining the correct position of anterior and dorsal boundaries in the forebrain by modulating FGF8 anteriorly and WNT signaling dorsally. Furthermore, BMP4 and FGF8 signaling are affected in the nasal region and BMP4 is ventrally expanded in the optic vesicle. At the optic cup stage, Pax6, Tbx5 and Bmp4 are ectopically expressed in the presumptive retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), while Otx2 and Mitf are not induced, leading to a dorsal transdifferentiation of RPE to neural retina. Therefore, besides being required for survival of ventral structures, retinoids are involved in restricting anterior identity in the telencephalon and dorsal identity in the diencephalon and the retina.
23204325	Mitogen-inducible gene 6 triggers apoptosis and exacerbates ER stress-induced β-cell death.	The increased insulin secretory burden placed on pancreatic β-cells during obesity and insulin resistance can ultimately lead to β-cell dysfunction and death and the development of type 2 diabetes. Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig6) is a cellular stress-responsive protein that can negatively regulate the duration and intensity of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling and has been classically viewed as a molecular brake for proliferation. In this study, we used Mig6 heterozygous knockout mice (Mig6(+/-)) to study the role of Mig6 in regulating β-cell proliferation and survival. Surprisingly, the proliferation rate of Mig6(+/-) pancreatic islets was lower than wild-type islets despite having comparable β-cell mass and glucose tolerance. We thus speculated that Mig6 regulates cellular death. Using adenoviral vectors to overexpress or knockdown Mig6, we found that caspase 3 activation during apoptosis was dependent on the level of Mig6. Interestingly, Mig6 expression was induced during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and its protein levels were maintained throughout ER stress. Using polyribosomal profiling, we identified that Mig6 protein translation was maintained, whereas the global protein translation was inhibited during ER stress. In addition, Mig6 overexpression exacerbated ER stress-induced caspase 3 activation in vitro. In conclusion, Mig6 is transcriptionally up-regulated and resistant to global translational inhibition during stressed conditions in β-cells and mediates apoptosis in the form of caspase 3 activation. The sustained production of Mig6 protein exacerbates ER stress-induced β-cell death. Thus, preventing the induction, translation, and/or function of Mig6 is warranted for increasing β-cell survival.
6701456	Demonstration of histamine receptors on human platelets by flow cytometry.	Fluoresceinated human albumin conjugated with histamine (FHA-HIS) has been used for the demonstration of histamine receptors on human platelets. Such receptors were demonstrated on 40-63% of peripheral blood platelets in 4 healthy donors. The binding of FHA-HIS was inhibited on 35-79% of the platelets by the histamine H1 receptor antagonists diphenhydramine and clemastine. The histamine H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine blocked the FHA-HIS binding on 14-37% of the platelets. It is concluded that histamine H1 as well as H2 receptors occur on human platelets but the receptors are not equally distributed in the platelet population.
15892618	Molecularly targeted therapy for gastrointestinal cancer.	Receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (TKs) have emerged as clinically useful drug target molecules for treating gastrointestinal cancer. Imatinib mesilate (STI-571, Gleevec(TM)), an inhibitior of bcr-abl TK, which was primarily designed to treat chronic myeloid leukemia is also an inhibitor of c-kit receptor TK, and is currently the drug of choice for the therapy of metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which frequently express constitutively activated forms of the c-kit-receptor. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is involved in cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis, is another important target. The two main classes of EGFR inhibitors are the TK inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa(TM)) has been on trial for esophageal and colorectal cancer (CRC) and erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva(TM)) on trial for esophageal, colorectal, hepatocellular, and biliary carcinoma. In addition, erlotinib has been evaluated in a Phase III study for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Cetuximab (IMC-C225, Erbitux(TM)), a monoclonal EGFR antibody, has been FDA approved for the therapy of irinotecan resistant colorectal cancer and has been tested for pancreatic cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR) are critical regulators of tumor angiogenesis. Bevacizumab (Avastin(TM)), a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, was efficient in two randomized clinical trials investigating the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. It is also currently investigated for the therapy of pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine. Other promising new drugs currently under preclinical and clinical evaluation, are VEGFR2 inhibitor PTK787/ZK 222584, thalidomide, farnesyl transferase inhibitor R115777 (tipifarnib, Zarnestra(TM)), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade(TM)), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) inhibitors, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitors, Rous sarcoma virus transforming oncogene (SRC) kinase inhibitors, histondeacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, small hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) inhibitors, aurora kinase inhibitors, hedgehog inhibitors, and TGF-beta signalling inhibitors.
17544870	Alteration of gastric functions and candidate genes associated with weight reduction in response to sibutramine.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is unclear whether weight loss with the noradrenergic (norepinephrine) and serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine) reuptake inhibitor, sibutramine, is associated with altered stomach functions and whether genetics influence treatment response. METHODS: Forty-eight overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants were randomized to placebo or sibutramine (15 mg/day for 12 weeks). At baseline and posttreatment we measured the following: gastric emptying for solids and liquids by scintigraphy, gastric volumes by single-photon emission computed tomography, maximum tolerated volume and 30-minute postnutrient challenge symptoms, and selected gastrointestinal hormones. All participants received structured behavior therapy for weight management. The influence of candidate gene polymorphisms involved in norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine or receptor function (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, guanine nucleotide binding protein beta polypeptide 3, alpha2A adrenoreceptor, and solute carrier family 6 [neurotransmitter transporter, serotonin] member 4 [homo sapiens] [SLC6A4]) on weight loss and gastric functions was evaluated. RESULTS: The overall average weight loss posttreatment was 5.4 +/- 0.8 (SEM) kg with sibutramine and 0.9 +/- 0.9 kg with placebo (P < .001). The sibutramine group showed significant retardation in gastric emptying of solids (P = .03), reduced maximum tolerated volume (P = .03), and increased postprandial peptide YY compared with the placebo group. Obese females showed greater effects of sibutramine on weight loss and gastric emptying of solids and liquids. Gastric volumes and postchallenge symptoms were not significantly different in the 2 treatment groups. The LS/SS genotype of the promoter for SLC6A4 was associated with enhanced weight loss with sibutramine. CONCLUSIONS: Weight reduction with sibutramine is associated with altered gastric functions and increased peptide YY and is significantly associated with SLC6A4 genotype. The role of genetic variation in SLC6A4 on weight loss in response to sibutramine deserves further study.
22815248	Protective Effects of a Purified Saponin Mixture from Astragalus corniculatus Bieb., in vivo Hepatotoxicity Models.	In this study, the in vivo effects of a purified saponin mixture (PSM), obtained from Astragalus corniculatus Bieb., were investigated using two in vivo hepatotoxicity models based on liver damage caused by paracetamol (PC) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ). The effects of PSM were compared with silymarin. Male Wistar rats were challenged orally with 20% CCl4 or PC (2 g/kg) four days after being pre-treated with PSM (100 mg/kg) or silymarin (200 mg/kg). A significant decrease of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and glutathione (GSH) levels and an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) quantity was observed after CCl4 and PC administration alone. PSM pre-treatment decreased serum transaminases and LDH activities and MDA levels and increased the levels of cell protector GSH. Biotransformation phase I enzymes were also assessed in both models. In the CCl4 hepatotoxicity model, pre-treatment with PSM or silymarin resulted in significantly increased activities of ethylmorphine-N-demethylase and aniline 4-hydroxylase activity and cytochrome P450, compared to the CCl4 only group. Neither silymarin nor PSM influenced PC biotransformation. Our results suggest that PSM, obtained from A. corniculatus, Bieb. showed in vivo hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities against CCl4 and PC-induced liver damage comparable to that of silymarin.

15060759	Binding of (-)-[3H]-CGP12177 at two sites in recombinant human beta 1-adrenoceptors and interaction with beta-blockers.	To verify the hypothesis that the non-conventional partial agonist (-)-CGP12177 binds at two beta(1)-adrenoceptor sites, human beta(1)-adrenoceptors, expressed in CHO cells, were labelled with (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177. We compared the binding affinity and antagonist potency of 12 clinically used beta-blockers against the cyclic AMP-enhancing effects of (-)-isoprenaline and (-)-CGP12177.(-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 bound to a high affinity site (H; K(H)=0.47 nM) and low affinity site (L); K(L)=235 nM). (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 dissociated from the beta(1)-adrenoceptors with a fast component (k(off)=0.45 min(-1)), consistent with the L-site, and a slow component (k(off)=0.017-0.033 min(-1)), consistent with the H-site. (-)-Isoprenaline and (-)-CGP12177 caused 96-fold and 12-fold maximal increases in cyclic AMP levels with -logEC(50)M of 8.2 and 7.6. (-)-CGP12177 antagonised the effects of (-)-isoprenaline with a pK(B) of 9.9. The beta-blockers antagonised the effects of (-)-isoprenaline more than the effects of (-)-CGP12177 with potency ratios: (-)-atenolol 1,000, (+/-)-metropolol 676, (-)-pindolol 631, (-)-timolol 589, (+/-)-carvedilol 204, (+/-)-oxprenolol 138, (+/-)-sotalol 132, (-)-propranolol 120, (+/-)-bisoprolol 95, (+/-)-alprenolol 81, (+/-)-nadolol 68 and (-)-bupranolol 56. In intact cells the binding constants of beta-blockers, estimated from competition with 3-5 nM (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 (binding to the H-site), correlated with the corresponding affinities estimated from antagonism of the (-)-isoprenaline effects. We conclude that (-)-[(3)H]-CGP12177 binds at two sites in the recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptor. (-)-CGP12177 is an antagonist of catecholamine effects through the H-site and a non-conventional partial agonist through the L-site. beta-blockers are more potent antagonists through the H-site than the L-site.
16249494	The effects of prostaglandin analogues on IOP in prostanoid FP-receptor-deficient mice.	PURPOSE: This study was designed to clarify the involvement of the prostanoid FP receptor in the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effects of latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, and unoprostone with the use of FP-receptor-deficient (FPKO) mice. METHODS: FPKO and wild-type (WT) mice were bred and acclimatized under a 12-hour light-dark cycle. IOP was measured under general anesthesia by a microneedle METHOD: To evaluate the effects of each drug, a single drop (3 muL) of each drug solution was topically applied in a masked manner to a randomly selected eye. IOP reduction was evaluated by the difference in IOP between the treated eye and the untreated contralateral eye in the same mouse. First, the diurnal variation and baseline IOP in WT and FPKO mice were measured. Then, to determine the window feasible for demonstrating the most marked ocular hypotensive effect, 0.005% latanoprost was applied to WT mice during the day or at night. The time when the ocular hypotensive effect was larger was selected for further studies to evaluate the effects of latanoprost (0.005%), travoprost (0.004%), bimatoprost (0.03%), and unoprostone (0.12%). In addition, bunazosin (0.1%) was also applied to demonstrate functional uveoscleral outflow in FPKO mice. All experiments were conducted under a masked study design. RESULTS: The baseline IOP (mean +/- SEM) in WT and FPKO mice was 15.0 +/- 0.2 and 15.0 +/- 0.3 mm Hg, respectively, during the day, and 18.9 +/- 0.4 and 19.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, respectively, at night. In WT mice, latanoprost significantly lowered IOP both during the day and at night, at 2 to 6 hours and 1 to 6 hours after application, respectively. Maximal IOP reduction was observed at 3 hours after drug instillation both during the day (10.9 +/- 1.8%) and at night (23.2 +/- 1.1%). At 3 hours after instillation, latanoprost (10.9 +/- 1.8% and 23.2 +/- 1.1%, daytime and nighttime, respectively), travoprost (15.9 +/- 1.4% and 26.1 +/- 1.2%) and bimatoprost (8.8 +/- 2.0 and 19.8 +/- 1.5%) significantly lowered IOP in WT mice both during the day and at night; isopropyl unoprostone significantly lowered IOP at night (13.7 +/- 1.9%) but not during the day (5.3 +/- 3.2%). In FPKO mice, latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, and unoprostone showed no significant IOP-lowering effect. Bunazosin significantly lowered IOP in both WT (22.1 +/- 1.6%) and FPKO mice (22.2 +/- 2.1%). CONCLUSIONS: A single application of latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, or unoprostone had no effect on IOP in FPKO mice with presumed functional uveoscleral outflow pathways. The prostanoid FP receptor plays a crucial role in the mechanism of early IOP lowering of all commercially available prostaglandin analogues.
10334992	Identification of a nuclear receptor for bile acids.	Bile acids are essential for the solubilization and transport of dietary lipids and are the major products of cholesterol catabolism. Results presented here show that bile acids are physiological ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), an orphan nuclear receptor. When bound to bile acids, FXR repressed transcription of the gene encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, and activated the gene encoding intestinal bile acid-binding protein, which is a candidate bile acid transporter. These results demonstrate a mechanism by which bile acids transcriptionally regulate their biosynthesis and enterohepatic transport.
1400062	Prolonged pulmonary hypertension caused by platelet-activating factor and leukotriene C4 in the rat lung.	Platelet-activating factor (PAF) and leukotrienes (LTs) are potent pulmonary hypertensive and inflammatory mediators produced by the lung. Previously we showed that a rapid injection of PAF into the pulmonary artery of an isolated rat lung produced an extended elevation in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). The objective of the present study was to determine whether the extended pressor response induced by PAF was caused by prolonged activation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway or slow clearance of LTs from the lung parenchyma. Rat lungs were perfused with a nonrecirculating physiological salt solution that contained indomethacin and albumin. Five minutes after a rapid injection of PAF into the pulmonary artery catheter, the following elevations (mean % above baseline) were observed: PAP (83%), LTB4 (3,260%), LTC4 (1,490%), LTD4 (970%), and LTE4 (1,500%). At 20 min these levels declined but were still significantly elevated above baseline. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor diethylcarbamazine (DEC), administered before the PAF injection, inhibited the elevations of PAP and all LTs. DEC administration that began 5 min after PAF reduced PAP and only LTC4 levels at 20 min in comparison to lungs with no DEC. The 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein inhibitor MK886, administered orally 2-6 h before perfusion, also inhibited the pressor response to PAF as well as LT production, as did DEC. We conclude that 1) the extended pulmonary hypertension induced by PAF was caused mainly by prolonged activation of 5-lipoxygenase with LTC4 production, 2) the relative overall lung clearance of LTB4, LTD4, and LTE4 was slower than that of LTC4, and 3) LTB4, LTD4, and LTE4 had no appreciable pressor effect.
23276150	Display of amino groups on substrate surfaces by simple dip-coating of methacrylate-based polymers and its application to DNA immobilization.	The implementation of a reactive functional group onto a material surface is of great importance. Reactive functional groups (e.g., an amino group and a hydroxyl group) are usually hydrophilic, which makes it difficult to display them on a dry polymer surface. We here propose a novel method for displaying amino groups on the surfaces of polymeric substrates through dip-coating of a methacrylate-based copolymer. We synthesized copolymers composed of methyl methacrylate and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate with different protecting groups or ion-complexes on their amino groups, then dip-coated the copolymers onto a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate. Evaluation using a cleavable fluorescent compound, which was synthesized in the present study to quantify a small amount (pmol/cm(2)) of amino groups on a solid surface, revealed that the protection of amino groups affected their surface segregation in the copolymer coating. p-Toluenesulfonate ion-complex and tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection of amino groups were found to effectively display amino groups on the surface (more than 70 pmol/cm(2)). The density of amino groups displayed on a surface can be easily controlled by mixing the copolymer and PMMA before dip-coating. Dip-coating of the copolymer with Boc protection on various polymeric substrates also successfully displayed amino groups on their surfaces. Finally, we demonstrated that the amino groups displayed can be utilized for the immobilization of a DNA oligonucleotide on a substrate surface.
23257178	Steroid toxicity and detoxification in ascomycetous fungi.	In the last couple of decades fungal infections have become a significant clinical problem. A major interest into fungal steroid action has been provoked since research has proven that steroid hormones are toxic to fungi and affect the host/fungus relationship. Steroid hormones were found to differ in their antifungal activity in ascomycetous fungi Hortaea werneckii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus oryzae. Dehydroepiandrosterone was shown to be the strongest inhibitor of growth in all three varieties of fungi followed by androstenedione and testosterone. For their protection, fungi use several mechanisms to lower the toxic effects of steroids. The efficiency of biotransformation in detoxification depended on the microorganism and steroid substrate used. Biotransformation was a relatively slow process as it also depended on the growth phase of the fungus. In addition to biotransformation, steroid extrusion out of the cells contributed to the lowering of the active intracellular steroid concentration. Plasma membrane Pdr5 transporter was found to be the most effective, followed by Snq2 transporter and vacuolar transporters Ybt1 and Ycf1. Proteins Aus1 and Dan1 were not found to be involved in steroid import. The research of possible targets of steroid hormone action in fungi suggests that steroid hormones inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae and H. werneckii. Results of this inhibition caused changes in the sterol content of the cellular membrane. The presence of steroid hormones most probably causes the degradation of the Tat2 permease and impairment of tryptophan import.
23239534	Threshold collision-induced dissociation of hydrated magnesium: experimental and theoretical investigation of the binding energies for Mg(2+)(H2O)x complexes (x=2-10).	The sequential bond energies of Mg(2+)(H2O)x complexes, in which x=2-10, are measured by threshold collision-induced dissociation in a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer. From an electrospray ionization source that produces an initial distribution of Mg(2+)(H2O)x complexes in which x=7-10, complexes down to x=3 are formed by using an in-source fragmentation technique. Complexes smaller than Mg(2+)(H2O)3 cannot be formed in this source because charge separation into MgOH(+)(H2O) and H3O(+) is a lower-energy pathway than simple water loss from Mg(2+)(H2O)3. The kinetic energy dependent cross sections for dissociation of Mg(2+)(H2O)x complexes, in which x=3-10, are examined over a wide energy range to monitor all dissociation products and are modeled to obtain 0 and 298 K binding energies. Analysis of both primary and secondary water molecule losses from each sized complex provides thermochemistry for the sequential hydration energies of Mg(2+) for x=2-10 and the first experimental values for x=2-4. Additionally, the thermodynamic onsets leading to the charge-separation products from Mg(2+)(H2O)3 and Mg(2+)(H2O)4 are determined for the first time. Our experimental results for x=3-7 agree well with quantum chemical calculations performed here and previously calculated binding enthalpies, as well as previous measurements for x=6. The present values for x=7-10 are slightly lower than previous experimental results and theory, but within experimental uncertainties.
23552265	UVA photoirradiation of benzo[a]pyrene metabolites: induction of cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species, and lipid peroxidation.	Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a prototype for studying carcinogenesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We have long been interested in studying the phototoxicity of PAHs. In this study, we determined that metabolism of BaP by human skin HaCaT keratinocytes resulted in six identified phase I metabolites, for example, BaP trans-7,8-dihydrodiol (BaP t-7,8-diol), BaP t-4,5-diol, BaP t-9,10-diol, 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (3-OH-BaP), BaP (7,10/8,9)tetrol, and BaP (7/8,9,10)tetrol. The photocytotoxicity of BaP, 3-OH-BaP, BaP t-7,8-diol, BaP trans-7,8-diol-anti-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), and BaP (7,10/8,9)tetrol in the HaCaT keratinocytes was examined. When irradiated with 1.0 J/cm(2) UVA light, these compounds when tested at doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 μM, all induced photocytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. When photoirradiation was conducted in the presence of a lipid (methyl linoleate), BaP metabolites, BPDE, and three related PAHs, pyrene, 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-BaP trans-7,8-diol, and 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-BaP trans-9,10-diol, all induced lipid peroxidation. The formation of lipid peroxides by BaP t-7,8-diol was inhibited by NaN3 and enhanced by deuterated methanol, which suggests that singlet oxygen may be involved in the generation of lipid peroxides. The formation of lipid hydroperoxides was partially inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD). Electron spin resonance spin trapping experiments indicated that both singlet oxygen and superoxide radical anion were generated from UVA photoirradiation of BPDE in a light dose responding manner.
20497523	Suppression of the inflammatory response in experimental arthritis is mediated via estrogen receptor alpha but not estrogen receptor beta.	INTRODUCTION: The immune modulatory role of estrogens in inflammation is complex. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of estrogens have been described. Estrogens bind both estrogen receptor (ER)alpha and beta. The contribution of ERalpha and ERbeta to ER-mediated immune modulation was studied in delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) and in experimental arthritis METHODS: ER-mediated suppression of rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) was studied using ethinyl-estradiol (EE) and a selective ERbeta agonist (ERB-79). Arthritis was followed for 2 weeks. Next, effects of ER agonists (ethinyl-estradiol, an ERalpha selective agonist (ERA-63) and a selective ERbeta agonist (ERB-79) on the development of a tetanus toxoid (TT)-specific delayed type hypersensitivity response in wild type (WT) and in ERalpha- or ERbeta-deficient mice were investigated. Finally, EE and ERA-63 were tested for their immune modulating potential in established collagen induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice. Arthritis was followed for three weeks. Joint pathology was examined by histology and radiology. Local synovial cytokine production was analyzed using Luminex technology. Sera were assessed for COMP as a biomarker of cartilage destruction. RESULTS: EE was found to suppress clinical signs and symptoms in rat AA. The selective ERbeta agonist ERB-79 had no effect on arthritis symptoms in this model. In the TT-specific DTH model, EE and the selective ERalpha agonist ERA-63 suppressed the TT-specific swelling response in WT and ERbetaKO mice but not in ERalphaKO mice. As seen in the AA model, the selective ERbeta agonist ERB-79 did not suppress inflammation. Treatment with EE or ERA-63 suppressed clinical signs in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in WT mice. This was associated with reduced inflammatory infiltrates and decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in CIA joints. CONCLUSIONS: ERalpha, but not ERbeta, is key in ER-mediated suppression of experimental arthritis. It remains to be investigated how these findings translate to human autoimmune disease.
17611273	Methylphenidate administration to juvenile rats alters brain areas involved in cognition, motivated behaviors, appetite, and stress.	Thousands of children receive methylphenidate (MPH; Ritalin) for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet the long-term neurochemical consequences of MPH treatment are unknown. To mimic clinical Ritalin treatment in children, male rats were injected with MPH (5 mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily from postnatal day 7 (PND7)-PND35. At the end of administration (PND35) or in adulthood (PND135), brain sections from littermate pairs were immunocytochemically labeled for neurotransmitters and cytological markers in 16 regions implicated in MPH effects and/or ADHD etiology. At PND35, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats given MPH showed 55% greater immunoreactivity (-ir) for the catecholamine marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 60% more Nissl-stained cells, and 40% less norepinephrine transporter (NET)-ir density. In hippocampal dentate gyrus, MPH-receiving rats showed a 51% decrease in NET-ir density and a 61% expanded distribution of the new-cell marker PSA-NCAM (polysialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule). In medial striatum, TH-ir decreased by 21%, and in hypothalamus neuropeptide Y-ir increased by 10% in MPH-exposed rats. At PND135, MPH-exposed rats exhibited decreased anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and a trend for decreased TH-ir in the mPFC. Neither PND35 nor PND135 rats showed major structural differences with MPH exposure. These findings suggest that developmental exposure to high therapeutic doses of MPH has short-term effects on select neurotransmitters in brain regions involved in motivated behaviors, cognition, appetite, and stress. Although the observed neuroanatomical changes largely resolve with time, chronic modulation of young brains with MPH may exert effects on brain neurochemistry that modify some behaviors even in adulthood.
16829128	More than cool: promiscuous relationships of menthol and other sensory compounds.	Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many "sensory compounds" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.
19428322	AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms underlying in vitro antiglioma action of compound C.	We investigated the effect of compound C, a well-known inhibitor of the intracellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), on proliferation and viability of human U251 and rat C6 glioma cell lines. Compound C caused G(2)/M cell cycle block, accompanied by apoptotic glioma cell death characterized by caspase activation, phosphatidylserine exposure and DNA fragmentation. The mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic action of compound C involved induction of oxidative stress and downregulation of antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2, while no alteration of pro-apoptotic Bax was observed. Compound C diminished AMPK phosphorylation and enzymatic activity, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of its target acetyl CoA carboxylase. AMPK activators metformin and AICAR partly prevented the cell cycle block, oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by compound C. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting of human AMPK mimicked compound C-induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, but failed to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis in U251 glioma cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that AMPK inhibition is required, but not sufficient for compound C-mediated apoptotic death of glioma cells.
23391631	The role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway in cardiotoxicity of acute lead intoxication in vivo and in vitro rat model.	Lead (Pb(2+)) is a naturally occurring systemic toxicant heavy metal that affects several organs in the body including the kidneys, liver, and central nervous system. However, Pb(2+)-induced cardiotoxicity has never been investigated yet and the exact mechanism of Pb(2+) associated cardiotoxicity has not been studied. The current study was designed to investigate the potential effect of Pb(2+) to induce cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro rat model and to explore the molecular mechanisms and the role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and regulated gene, cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1), in Pb(2+)-mediated cardiotoxicity. For these purposes, Wistar albino rats were treated with Pb(2+) (25, 50 and 100mg/kg, i.p.) for three days and the effects on physiological and histopathological parameters of cardiotoxicity were determined. At the in vitro level, rat cardiomyocyte H9c2 cell lines were incubated with increasing concentration of Pb(2+) (25, 50, and 100μM) and the expression of hypertrophic genes, α- and β-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC and β-MHC), brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), and CYP1A1 were determined at the mRNA and protein levels using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. The results showed that Pb(2+) significantly induced cardiotoxicity and heart failure as evidenced by increase cardiac enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase and changes in histopathology in vivo. In addition, Pb(2+) treatment induced β-MHC and BNP whereas inhibited α-MHC mRNA and protein levels in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, at the in vitro level, Pb(2+) treatment induced both β-MHC and α-MHC mRNA levels in time- and dose-dependent manner. Importantly, these changes were accompanied with a proportional increase in the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA and protein expression levels, suggesting a role for the CYP1A1 in cardiotoxicity. The direct evidence for the involvement of CYP1A1 in the induction of cardiotoxicity by Pb(2+) was evidenced by the ability of AhR antagonist, resveratrol, to significantly inhibit the Pb(2+)-modulated effect on β-MHC and α-MHC mRNAs. It was concluded that acute lead exposure induced cardiotoxicity through AhR/CYP1A1-mediated mechanism.
23142547	A non-catalytic function of Rev1 in translesion DNA synthesis and mutagenesis is mediated by its stable interaction with Rad5.	DNA damage tolerance consisting of template switching and translesion synthesis is a major cellular mechanism in response to unrepaired DNA lesions during replication. The Rev1 pathway constitutes the major mechanism of translesion synthesis and base damage-induced mutagenesis in model cell systems. Rev1 is a dCMP transferase, but additionally plays non-catalytic functions in translesion synthesis. Using the yeast model system, we attempted to gain further insights into the non-catalytic functions of Rev1. Rev1 stably interacts with Rad5 (a central component of the template switching pathway) via the C-terminal region of Rev1 and the N-terminal region of Rad5. Supporting functional significance of this interaction, both the Rev1 pathway and Rad5 are required for translesion synthesis and mutagenesis of 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine. Furthermore, disrupting the Rev1-Rad5 interaction by mutating Rev1 did not affect its dCMP transferase, but led to inactivation of the Rev1 non-catalytic function in translesion synthesis of UV-induced DNA damage. Deletion analysis revealed that the C-terminal 21-amino acid sequence of Rev1 is uniquely required for its interaction with Rad5 and is essential for its non-catalytic function. Deletion analysis additionally implicated a C-terminal region of Rev1 in its negative regulation. These results show that a non-catalytic function of Rev1 in translesion synthesis and mutagenesis is mediated by its interaction with Rad5.
17704420	FCGR2A and FCGR3A polymorphisms associated with clinical outcome of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with single-agent cetuximab.	PURPOSE: Cetuximab, a chimeric immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG1) anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody (mAb), has shown efficacy in 10% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent studies demonstrate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of the modes of action for rituximab and trastuzumab. Fragment c (Fc) portion of IgG1 mAb has shown to induce ADCC. Fragment c gamma receptors (FcgammaR) play an important role in initiating ADCC. Studies have shown that two IgG FcgammaR polymorphisms (FCGR2A-H131R and FCGR3A-V158F) independently predict response to rituximab in patients with follicular lymphoma. We tested the hypothesis of whether these two polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcome in metastatic CRC patients treated with single-agent cetuximab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine metastatic CRC patients were enrolled onto the ImClone0144 trial. Using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based method, gene polymorphisms of FCGA2A-H131R and FCGA3A-V158F were assessed from genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples. RESULTS: FCGR2A-H131R and FCGR3A-V158F polymorphisms were independently associated with progression-free survival (PFS; P = .037 and .055, respectively; log-rank test). Combined analysis of these two polymorphisms showed that patients with the favorable genotypes (FCGR2A, any histidine allele, and FCGR3A, any phenylalanine allele) showed a median PFS of 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.4 months), whereas patients with any two unfavorable genotypes (FCGR2A arginine/arginine or valine/valine) had a PFS of 1.1 months (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4 months; P = .004; log-rank test). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest that these two polymorphisms may be useful molecular markers to predict clinical outcome in metastatic CRC patients treated with cetuximab and that they may indicate a role of ADCC of cetuximab.
21926191	Cabozantinib (XL184), a novel MET and VEGFR2 inhibitor, simultaneously suppresses metastasis, angiogenesis, and tumor growth.	The signaling pathway of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is important for cell growth, survival, and motility and is functionally linked to the signaling pathway of VEGF, which is widely recognized as a key effector in angiogenesis and cancer progression. Dysregulation of the MET/VEGF axis is found in a number of human malignancies and has been associated with tumorigenesis. Cabozantinib (XL184) is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor with potent activity toward MET and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), as well as a number of other receptor tyrosine kinases that have also been implicated in tumor pathobiology, including RET, KIT, AXL, and FLT3. Treatment with cabozantinib inhibited MET and VEGFR2 phosphorylation in vitro and in tumor models in vivo and led to significant reductions in cell invasion in vitro. In mouse models, cabozantinib dramatically altered tumor pathology, resulting in decreased tumor and endothelial cell proliferation coupled with increased apoptosis and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in breast, lung, and glioma tumor models. Importantly, treatment with cabozantinib did not increase lung tumor burden in an experimental model of metastasis, which has been observed with inhibitors of VEGF signaling that do not target MET. Collectively, these data suggest that cabozantinib is a promising agent for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in cancers with dysregulated MET and VEGFR signaling.
2922761	Retinoid-induced hemorrhaging and bone toxicity in rats fed diets deficient in vitamin K.	The recent increase in the clinical use of synthetic vitamin A compounds has led to concern of possible side effects. Some of these effects are known to be influenced by dietary levels of vitamin K. We therefore compared the toxic effects of 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cisRA), retinyl acetate (ROAc), and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR) in male Sprague-Dawley rats maintained on diets containing different levels of vitamin K. Animals were fed either an NIH-07 diet supplemented with menadione (3.1 ppm vitamin K3), an NIH-07 diet not supplemented with menadione, or an AIN-076 purified diet devoid of vitamin K. The retinoids had no effect on prothrombin times of animals fed the supplemented diet. When menadione was omitted from the diet, however, 4HPR-dosed animals had elevated prothrombin times. This effect was observed as early as Day 7 and was accompanied by one confirmed hemorrhagic death. 13cisRA-dosed animals showed no change in prothrombin times. In the high-dose ROAc group, there was a twofold increase in prothrombin times but only after prolonged dosing. In animals fed the NIH-07 diets, 13cisRA and ROAc induced multiple bone fractures at all dose levels. In contrast, 4HPR administered at the highest dose induced only one fracture in one animal. Animals fed the purified diet lost weight faster and diet sooner than those maintained on the other diets. Bone fractures were not observed in these animals because of early deaths resulting from hemorrhaging. For all retinoid-dosed groups maintained on the purified diet, changes in prothrombin times occured as early as 1 week. The order of effect was 4HPR greater than ROAc greater than 13cisRA, with increases in prothrombin times correlating with increases in hemorrhagic deaths. Hence, the degree of retinoid-induced hemorrhage, but not the incidence of bone fractures, was inversely related to vitamin K levels in the diet. 13cisRA and ROAc, but not 4HPR, caused a dose-dependent reduction in plasma osteocalcin, an effect that correlated with retinoid-induced bone effects. In contrast, serum alkaline phosphatase was elevated in animals dosed with 13cisRA or 4HPR but not in those dose with ROAc. For this enzyme, the electrophoretic pattern on agarose gel showed a decrease, compared to controls, in the major isozyme in serum of ROAc-dosed animals. Hence, plasma osteocalcin is a better predictor of retinoid-induced bone effects than serum alkaline phosphatase.
23087261	Lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination of organic anion transporter-1 is essential for its protein kinase C-regulated endocytosis.	Organic anion transporter-1 (OAT1) mediates the body's disposition of a diverse array of environmental toxins and clinically important drugs. Therefore, understanding the regulation of this transporter has profound clinical significance. We had previously established that OAT1 undergoes constitutive internalization from and recycling back to the cell surface and that acute activation of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibits OAT1 activity by reducing OAT1 cell-surface expression through accelerating its internalization from cell surface to intracellular compartments. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the current study, we provide novel evidence that acute activation of PKC significantly enhances OAT1 ubiquitination both in vitro and ex vivo. We further show that ubiquitination of cell-surface OAT1 increases in cells transfected with dominant negative mutant of dynamin-2, a maneuver blocking OAT1 internalization, which suggests that OAT1 ubiquitination proceeds before OAT1 internalization. Mass spectroscopy has revealed that ubiquitination of OAT1 consists of polyubiquitin chains, primarily through lysine 48 linkage. Transfection of cells with the dominant negative mutant of ubiquitin Ub-K48R, which prevents the formation of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, abolishes PKC-stimulated OAT1 ubiquitination and internalization. Together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that Lys48-linked polyubiquitination is essential for PKC-regulated OAT1 trafficking.
18408530	Clinical evidence for serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition of duloxetine.	Most antidepressants in clinical use are believed to function by enhancing neurotransmission of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] and/or norepinephrine (NE) via inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake. Agents that affect reuptake of both 5-HT and NE (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) have been postulated to offer greater efficacy for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). These dual-acting agents also display a broader spectrum of action, including efficacy for MDD and associated painful physical symptoms, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and fibromyalgia syndrome. Substantial preclinical evidence shows that duloxetine, an approved drug for the treatment of MDD, generalized anxiety disorder, and the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, inhibits reuptake of both 5-HT and NE. This paper reviews clinical and neurochemical evidence of duloxetine's effects on 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition. The clinical evidence supporting duloxetine's effects on NE reuptake inhibition includes indirect measures such as altered excretion of NE metabolites, cardiovascular effects, and treatment-emergent adverse event profiles similar to those for other drugs believed to act through the inhibition of NE reuptake. In summary, the data presented in this report provide clinical evidence of a mechanism for duloxetine involving both 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibition in humans and are consistent with preclinical evidence for 5-HT/NE reuptake inhibition.
22585533	β-Eudesmol induces JNK-dependent apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway in HL60 cells.	β-eudesmol, a natural sesquiterpenol present in a variety of Chinese herbs, is known to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms of the effect of β-eudesmol on human tumor cells are unknown. In the present study, we report the cytotoxic effect of β-eudesmol on the human leukemia HL60 cells and its molecular mechanisms. The cytotoxic effect of β-eudesmol on HL60 cells was associated with apoptosis, which was characterized by the presence of DNA fragmentation. β-eudesmol-induced apoptosis was accompanied by cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; downregulation of Bcl-2 expression; release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases was observed in β-eudesmol-treated HL60 cells, and the inhibitor of JNK blocked the β-eudesmol-induced apoptosis, downregulation of Bcl-2, and the loss of MMP. These data suggest that β-eudesmol induces apoptosis in HL60 cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which is controlled through JNK signaling. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
23613149	Dietary Flaxseed Oil Supplementation Mitigates the Effect of Lead on the Enzymes of Carbohydrate Metabolism, Brush Border Membrane, and Oxidative Stress in Rat Kidney Tissues.	Lead is a heavy metal widely distributed in the environment. Lead is a ubiquitous environmental toxin that is capable of causing numerous acute and chronic illnesses. Human and animal exposure demonstrates that lead is nephrotoxic. However, attempts to reduce lead-induced nephrotoxicity were not found suitable for clinical use. Recently, flaxseed oil (FXO), a rich source of ω-3 fatty acids and lignans, has been shown to prevent/reduce the progression of certain types of cardiovascular and renal disorders. In view of this, the present study investigates the protective effect of FXO on lead acetate (PbAc)-induced renal damage. Rats were pre-fed normal diet and the diet rich in FXO for 14 days, and then, four doses of lead acetate (25 mg/kg body weight) were administered intraperitoneally while still on diet. Various serum parameters, enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, brush border membrane (BBM), and oxidative stress were analyzed in rat kidney. PbAc nephrotoxicity was characterized by increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. PbAc increased the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and NADP-malic enzyme, whereas it decreased malate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase, and BBM enzyme activities. PbAc caused oxidant/antioxidant imbalances as reflected by increased lipid peroxidation and decreased activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. In contrast, FXO alone enhanced the enzyme activities of carbohydrate metabolism, BBM, and antioxidant defense system. FXO feeding to PbAc-treated rats markedly enhanced resistance to PbAc-elicited deleterious effects. In conclusion, dietary FXO supplementation ameliorated PbAc-induced specific metabolic alterations and oxidative damage by empowering antioxidant defense mechanism and improving BBM integrity and energy metabolism.
23454149	Inhibition of angiogenesis and invasion by DMBT is mediated by downregulation of VEGF and MMP-9 through Akt pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.	Invasion, either directly or via metastasis formation, is the main cause of death in cancer patients, development of efficient anti-invasive agents is an important research challenge. In order to obtain more potent inhibitors, a series of brartemicin analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against invasion. Among the synthetic analogs tested, DMBT, 6,6'-bis (2,3-dimethoxybenzoyl)-a,a-d-trehalose, was found to be the most potent anti-invasive agent. But the effects of DMBT on breast cancer cells were not known. In this study, the effects of DMBT on invasion and metastasis in MDA-MB-231 cells were investigated. MTT assay showed that no obvious inhibitory or cytotoxic effect of DMBT was found. DMBT could inhibit invasion, migration and tube formation of HUVECs. Gelatin zymography showed that DMBT inhibited secretion and activity of MMP-9. Western blotting demonstrated that DMBT effectively suppressed the expression of VEGF, p-VEGFR-2, p-EGFR, and p-Akt. These results suggested that DMBT could inhibit invasion and angiogenesis by downregulation of VEGFand MMP-9, resulting from the inhibition of Akt pathway. DMBT might be a promising lead molecule for the anti-metastasis and serve as a therapeutic agent to inhibit breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
11067741	Stable expression of varied levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase in primary cultures of endothelial cells.	Nitric oxide (NO*), generated by nitric oxide synthase (NOS II) from immunostimulated cells during infection, plays an important role in host immune defense against microbial invasion. The impact of different rates of NO* production on host cell function has not been defined. Herein, we describe the development of a method to express varied levels of murine NOS II in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. A retroviral vector (pMFGSNOS) encoding NOS II was used to transduce primary cultures of endothelial cells. Bovine endothelial cells were susceptible to this transduction and up to 18% of the cells expressed immunodetectable murine NOS II. The NOS II-transduced endothelial cells were cultured on the three-dimensional matrix, Gelfoam, for 8-10 days. Stable expression of NOS II was assessed by measuring nitrite accumulation in media every 2 days. By day 10, endothelial cells on Gelfoam were found to secrete NO* at a rate exceeding 1.0 microM/h/10(6) cells, concomitant with an enhanced level of NOS II activity. Argininosuccinate synthetase, a key enzyme in the metabolism of l-citrulline to l-arginine, increased as well, perhaps in response to dimunition of the intracellular arginine pool corresponding to the observed high output of NO*. In spite of the continuous flux of NO*, endothelial cell viability was not effected. This system provides the opportunity to assess the impact of different levels of sustained NO* production on endothelial cell physiology.
23228182	Amino acid-based zwitterionic poly(serine methacrylate) as an antifouling material.	A serine-based zwitterionic poly(serine methacrylate) (pSerMA) was developed in this work to be used as a potential antifouling material. A surface-initiated photoiniferter-mediated polymerization (SI-PIMP) method was used to graft polymer brushes on gold surfaces. The pSerMA-grafted samples with different polymer film thicknesses were readily prepared by varying the UV-irradiation time. With the optimal film thickness, the adsorptions from bovine serum albumin, human serum, and human plasma onto the pSerMA-grafted surfaces, as evaluated by a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor, were 1.8, 9.2, and 12.9 ng/cm(2), respectively, comparable to the traditional antifouling material such as poly(ethylene glycol). The pSerMA-grafted surfaces also strongly resisted adhesion from bovine aortic endothelial cells. This is the first work to develop an amino acid-based zwitterionic polymer as an antifouling material, demonstrating that pSerMA is a promising alternative to the traditional ethylene glycol-based antifouling materials.
22722028	Deep brain stimulation, histone deacetylase inhibitors and glutamatergic drugs rescue resistance to fear extinction in a genetic mouse model.	Anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent, excessive fear. Therapeutic interventions that reverse deficits in fear extinction represent a tractable approach to treating these disorders. We previously reported that 129S1/SvImJ (S1) mice show no extinction learning following normal fear conditioning. We now demonstrate that weak fear conditioning does permit fear reduction during massed extinction training in S1 mice, but reveals specific deficiency in extinction memory consolidation/retrieval. Rescue of this impaired extinction consolidation/retrieval was achieved with d-cycloserine (N-methly-d-aspartate partial agonist) or MS-275 (histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor), applied after extinction training. We next examined the ability of different drugs and non-pharmacological manipulations to rescue the extreme fear extinction deficit in S1 following normal fear conditioning with the ultimate aim to produce low fear levels in extinction retrieval tests. Results showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) by applying high frequency stimulation to the nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum) during extinction training, indeed significantly reduced fear during extinction retrieval compared to sham stimulation controls. Rescue of both impaired extinction acquisition and deficient extinction consolidation/retrieval was achieved with prior extinction training administration of valproic acid (a GABAergic enhancer and HDAC inhibitor) or AMN082 [metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7) agonist], while MS-275 or PEPA (AMPA receptor potentiator) failed to affect extinction acquisition in S1 mice. Collectively, these data identify potential beneficial effects of DBS and various drug treatments, including those with HDAC inhibiting or mGlu7 agonism properties, as adjuncts to overcome treatment resistance in exposure-based therapies. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
23183374	A combined nuclear and nucleolar localization motif in activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) controls immunoglobulin class switching.	Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a DNA mutator enzyme essential for adaptive immunity. AID initiates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (CSR) by deaminating cytosine to uracil in specific immunoglobulin (Ig) gene regions. However, other loci, including cancer-related genes, are also targeted. Thus, tight regulation of AID is crucial to balance immunity versus disease such as cancer. AID is regulated by several mechanisms including nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Here we have studied nuclear import kinetics and subnuclear trafficking of AID in live cells and characterized in detail its nuclear localization signal. Importantly, we find that the nuclear localization signal motif also directs AID to nucleoli where it colocalizes with its interaction partner, catenin-β-like 1 (CTNNBL1), and physically associates with nucleolin and nucleophosmin. Moreover, we demonstrate that release of AID from nucleoli is dependent on its C-terminal motif. Finally, we find that CSR efficiency correlates strongly with the arithmetic product of AID nuclear import rate and DNA deamination activity. Our findings suggest that directional nucleolar transit is important for the physiological function of AID and demonstrate that nuclear/nucleolar import and DNA cytosine deamination together define the biological activity of AID. This is the first study on subnuclear trafficking of AID and demonstrates a new level in its complex regulation. In addition, our results resolve the problem related to dissociation of deamination activity and CSR activity of AID mutants.
22982445	Leukotriene D4 induces cognitive impairment through enhancement of CysLT₁ R-mediated amyloid-β generation in mice.	Amyloid plaques in the extracellular parenchyma mainly consist of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ), one of the pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we examined neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, and memory performance following intracerebral infusions of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) in mice. The results demonstrated that intracerebral infusions of LTD4 (1 ng/mouse) produced memory impairment as determined by Morris water maze test and Y-maze test in mice, and caused the accumulation of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 in the hippocampus and cortex through increased activity of β- and γ-secretases accompanied with increased expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP). LTD4 also induced expression of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT(1)R) and NF-κB p65 in the hippocampus and cortex. Pretreatment with pranlukast (1.5 ng/mouse, intracerebroventricularly), a CysLT(1)R antagonist, blocked LTD4-induced amyloidogenesis, memory deficits. Pranlukast (0.6 μM) also prevented LTD4 (20 nM)-induced amyloidogenesis in the cultured neurons in vitro. Moreover, LTD4-induced increases in CysLT(1)R and NF-κB p65 in the brain were also attenuated by pranlukast. These results suggest that LTD4 increases Aβ peptide burden via activation of CysLT(1)R, which further affects APP levels and activity of β- and γ-secretases via the NF-κB pathway. Our findings identify CysLT(1)R signaling as a novel proinflammatory and proamyloidogenic pathway, and suggest a rationale for development of therapeutics targeting the CysLT(1)R in neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.
11340119	Stability of vitamin B-6-dependent aminotransferase activity in frozen packed erythrocytes is dependent on storage temperature.	Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) stimulation of erythrocyte alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (EALT, EAST) activities is a frequently used functional measure of vitamin B-6 status. Stability of enzyme activities and activity coefficients (AC, stimulated / unstimulated) was assessed in packed erythrocytes frozen at -20, -80 degrees C and under liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C). Activities of EALT and EAST, with and without added PLP, were determined in fresh erythrocytes (d 0) and frozen samples on d 1, 7, 14, 28, 58 and 84. In -20 degrees C samples, EALT basal activity decreased 17 and 22% (P < or = 0.05 for both) by d 58 and 84, respectively, and EAST basal activity decreased 40% (P < or = 0.05) by d 58. In -80 and -196 degrees C samples, EALT and EAST basal activities did not change significantly. Activity coefficients did not differ significantly from d 0 at any storage temperature, but EAST-AC increased 9-19% (nonsignificant) in samples stored at -20 and -80 degrees C for 7 to 84 d. Additionally, EAST-AC was significantly higher in -20 than -80 and -196 degrees C samples on d 1 and 58, respectively. Erythrocytes may be frozen for 28 d at -20 degrees C and 84 d at -80 degrees C before analysis for EALT; for EAST, activity should be measured on fresh erythrocytes.
15199474	P2Y12, a new platelet ADP receptor, target of clopidogrel.	Clopidogrel is a potent antithrombotic drug that inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. The antiaggregating effect of clopidogrel is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of ADP binding to a purinergic receptor present at the platelet surface. Clopidogrel is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. The chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. Several purinergic receptors have been described on platelets; P2X (1), a calcium channel, and P2Y1 a Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor, have been found not to be antagonized by clopidogrel. Another Gi (2)-coupled receptor (named P2Y12) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells. These cells displayed a strong affinity for (33)P-2MeS-ADP, a stable analogue of ADP, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. The binding of (33)P-2MeS-ADP to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets. In these transfected CHO cells, as in platelets, ADP and 2MeS-ADP induced adenylyl cyclase downregulation, an effect that was inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel. These results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called "P2t" platelet receptor and show that the active metabolite of clopidogrel binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of ADP on platelets.
16395286	Dose-response effect of tetracyclines on cerebral matrix metalloproteinase-9 after vascular endothelial growth factor hyperstimulation.	Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are a potentially life-threatening disorder. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity was greatly increased in BAVM tissue specimens. Doxycycline was shown to decrease cerebral MMP-9 activities and angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In the present study, we determined the dose-response effects of doxycycline and minocycline on cerebral MMP-9 using our mouse model with VEGF focal hyperstimulation delivered with adenoviral vector (AdVEGF) in the brain. Mice were treated with doxycycline or minocycline, respectively, at 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day through drinking water for 1 week. Our results have shown that MMP-9 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was inhibited by doxycycline starting at 10 mg/kg/day (P<0.02). Minocycline showed more potent inhibition on MMP-9 mRNA expression, starting at 1 (P<0.005) and further at more than 30 (P<0.001) mg/kg/day. At the enzymatic activity level, doxycycline started to suppress MMP-9 activity at 5 mg/kg/day (P<0.001), while minocycline had an effect at a lower dose, 1 mg/kg/day (P<0.02). The inhibition of cerebral MMP-9 mRNA and activity were highly correlated with drug levels in the brain tissue. We also assessed the potential relevant signaling pathway in vitro to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the MMP-9 inhibition by tetracyclines. In vitro, minocycline, but not doxycycline, inhibits MMP-9, at least in part, via the extracellular signaling-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-mediated pathway. This study provided the evidence that the tetracyclines inhibit stimulated cerebral MMP-9 at multiple levels and are effective at very low doses, offering great potential for therapeutic use.
8484964	Purification of nonantibiotic insulinase inhibitors from bacitracin.	Bacitracin is commonly used in metabolic studies as an insulinase inhibitor. The many isoforms of the commercial preparation were fractionated by charge and size in order to find the most active rat-muscle insulinase inhibitors. CM-Sepharose chromatography revealed that most of the inhibitory activity was contained in a fraction (CM-Inh) that amounted to less than 5% of the mixture. The CM-Inh fraction could be further separated by size on Bio-Gel P4 columns. Six subgroups, each with characteristic specific activity, were isolated. The most potent inhibitor fractions have no antibiotic activity and have molecular weights about twice that of bacitracin A. The peaks isolated by means of Bio-Gel P4 chromatography can be further fractionated by reversed phase HPLC on a C8 column, and by electrophoresis on nonreducing acrylamide gels.
19549602	Amitriptyline is a TrkA and TrkB receptor agonist that promotes TrkA/TrkB heterodimerization and has potent neurotrophic activity.	Neurotrophins, the cognate ligands for the Trk receptors, are homodimers and induce Trk dimerization through a symmetric bivalent mechanism. We report here that amitriptyline, an antidepressant drug, directly binds TrkA and TrkB and triggers their dimerization and activation. Amitriptyline, but not any other tricyclic or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, promotes TrkA autophosphorylation in primary neurons and induces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Amitriptyline binds the extracellular domain of both TrkA and TrkB and promotes TrkA-TrkB receptor heterodimerization. Truncation of amitriptyline binding motif on TrkA abrogates the receptor dimerization by amitriptyline. Administration of amitriptyline to mice activates both receptors and significantly reduces kainic acid-triggered neuronal cell death. Inhibition of TrkA, but not TrkB, abolishes amitriptyline's neuroprotective effect without impairing its antidepressant activity. Thus, amitriptyline acts as a TrkA and TrkB agonist and possesses marked neurotrophic activity.
12517247	Eprosartan for the treatment of hypertension.	Antihypertensive agents are proven to reduce the cardiovascular risk of stroke, coronary heart disease and cardiac failure. The ideal antihypertensive agent should control all grades of hypertension and have a placebo-like side effect profile. Angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists are a relatively new class of antihypertensive agent that block AII Type 1 (AT(1)) receptors, and reduce the pressor effects of AII in the vasculature. By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure. However, AII receptor blockers differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, a side effect which may be related to bradykinin or other mediators such as substance P. Within the class of AII blockers, eprosartan differs from other currently available agents in terms of chemical structure, as it is a non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole, non-peptide antagonist with a dual pharmacological mode of action. Eprosartan acts at vascular AT(1) receptors (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic AT(1) receptors, where it inhibits sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Its lack of metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes confers a low potential for metabolic drug interactions and may be of importance when treating elderly patients and those on multiple drugs. In clinical trials, eprosartan has been demonstrated to be at least as effective in reducing blood pressure as the ACE inhibitor enalapril, and has significantly lower side effects. Eprosartan is safe, effective and well-tolerated in long-term treatment, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide.
23578968	Evaluation of a predictive in vitro Leydig cell assay for anti-androgenicity of phthalate esters in the rat.	An in vitro assay using the rat Leydig cell line R2C was evaluated for its ability to quantitatively predict inhibition of testosterone synthesis. Results obtained for endocrine active phthalates (MEHP, MBP), and inactive phthalates (MMP and MEP) were highly consistent with in vivo results based on tissue and media concentrations. Statistically significant inhibition of testosterone synthesis (p<0.05, 1-way ANOVA) was observed at 1μM MBP and 3μM MEHP, while MEP and MMP did not affect inhibition of testosterone synthesis until much higher concentrations (≫100μM). Concentrations causing 50% inhibition of testosterone synthesis for MBP and MEHP (3 and 6μM respectively), were similar to in vivo values (3 and 7μM). The R2C assay was used to determine the relative potency of 14 structurally diverse monoesters and oxidative metabolites of MEHP. Monoesters with alkyl chains 4-5 carbons in length had the highest potency for testosterone inhibition, while 0-2 carbon alkyl chains were least potent. Phase I metabolism did not completely inactivate MEHP, underscoring the need for metabolism data when interpreting in vitro pharmacodynamic data. This steroid inhibition assay provides a predictive in vitro alternative to expensive and timeconsuming developmental rat studies for phthalate-induced antiandrogenicity.
15546741	9-cis-retinoic acid analogues with bulky hydrophobic rings: new RXR-selective agonists.	Stille cross-coupling of aryltriflates 10 and dienylstannane 11, oxidation and Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction afforded stereoselectively retinoates 15. Saponification provided the carboxylic acids 8a and 8b, retinoids that incorporate a bulky hydrophobic ring while preserving the 9-cis-geometry of the parent system. In contrast to the pan-RAR/RXR agonistic profile of the lower homologue of 8a, compound 7 (LG100567), retinoids 8 showed selective binding and transactivation of RXR, devoid of significant RAR activation. In PLB985 leukemia cells that require RXR agonists for differentiation compounds 8 induced maturation in the presence of the RAR-selective pan-agonist TTNPB; this effect was blocked by an RXR-selective antagonist.
18773878	DNA damage and homologous recombination signaling induced by thymidylate deprivation.	DNA damage is accepted as a consequence of thymidylate deprivation induced by chemotherapeutic inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TS), but the types of damage and signaling responses remain incompletely understood. Thymidylate deprivation increases dUTP and uracil in DNA, which is removed by base excision repair (BER). Because BER requires a synthesis step, strand break intermediates presumably accumulate. Thymidylate deprivation also induces cell cycle arrest during replication. Homologous recombination (HR) is a means of repairing persistent BER intermediates and collapsed replication forks. There are also intimate links between HR and S-phase checkpoint pathways. In this study, the goals were to determine the involvement of HR-associated proteins and DNA damage signaling responses to thymidylate deprivation. When RAD51, which is a central component of HR, was depleted by siRNA cells were sensitized to raltitrexed (RTX), which specifically inhibits TS. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in mammalian cells that depletion of RAD51 causes sensitivity to thymidylate deprivation. Activation of DNA damage signaling responses was examined following treatment with RTX. Phosphorylation of replication protein A (RPA2 subunit) and formation of damage-induced foci were strikingly evident following IC(50) doses of RTX. Induction was much more striking following RTX treatment than with hydroxyurea, which is commonly used to inhibit replication. RTX treatment also induced foci of RAD51, gamma-H2AX, phospho-Chk1, and phospho-NBS1, although the extent of co-localization with RPA2 foci varied. Collectively, the results suggest that HR and S-phase checkpoint signaling processes are invoked by thymidylate deprivation and influence cellular resistance to thymidylate deprivation.
23489521	The use of insulin analogues in pregnancy.	Excellent glycaemic control is essential in pregnancy to optimise maternal and foetal outcomes. The aim of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of insulin analogues in pregnancy. Insulin lispro and insulin aspart are safe in pregnancy and may improve post-prandial glycaemic control in women with type 1 diabetes. However, a lack of data indicating improved foetal outcomes would suggest that there is no imperative to switch to a short-acting analogue where the woman's diabetes is well controlled with human insulin. There are no reports of the use of insulin glulisine in pregnancy and so its use cannot be recommended. Most studies of insulin glargine in pregnancy are small, retrospective and include women with pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes. There appear to be no major safety concerns and so it seems reasonable to continue insulin glargine if required to achieve excellent glycaemic control. A head-to-head comparison between insulin detemir and NPH insulin in women with type 1 diabetes showed that while foetal outcomes did not differ, fasting plasma glucose improved with insulin detemir without an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia. The greater evidence base supports the use of insulin detemir as the first line long-acting analogue in pregnancy but the lack of definitive foetal benefits means that there is no strong need to switch a woman who is well controlled on NPH insulin. There seems little justification in using long acting insulin analogues in women with gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes where the risk of hypoglycaemia is low.
23572520	S-nitrosation of glutathione transferase P1-1 is controlled by the conformation of a dynamic active-site helix.	S-nitrosation is a post-translational modification of protein cysteine residues which occurs in response to cellular oxidative stress. Although it is increasingly being linked to physiologically important processes, the molecular basis for protein regulation by this modification remains poorly understood. We used transient kinetic methods to determine a minimal mechanism for spontaneous GSNO-mediated transnitrosation of human glutathione transferase (GST) P1-1, a major detoxification enzyme and key regulator of cell proliferation. C47 of GSTP1-1 is S-nitrosated in two steps, with the chemical step limited by a pre-equilibrium between the open and closed conformations of helix α2 at the active site. C101, in contrast, is S-nitrosated in a single step but is subject to negative cooperativity due to steric hindrance at the dimer interface. Despite the presence of a GSNO binding site at the active site of GSTP1-1, isothermal titration calorimetry as well as nitrosation experiments using CysNO demonstrate that GSNO binding does not precede S-nitrosation of GSTP1-1. Kinetics experiments using the cellular reductant GSH show that C101-NO is substantially more resistant to denitrosation than C47-NO, suggesting a potential role for C101-NO in long term nitric oxide storage or transfer. These results constitute the first report of the molecular mechanism of spontaneous protein transnitrosation, providing insight into the post-translational control of GSTP1-1 as well as the process of protein transnitrosation in general.
1600046	Review article: 5-hydroxytryptamine agonists and antagonists in the modulation of gastrointestinal motility and sensation: clinical implications.	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is found in the enteric nervous system where it has been implicated in controlling gastrointestinal motor function. A number of receptor or recognition sites have been identified in the gut, but recently most attention has focused on the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. The functional role of the 5-HT3 receptor remains incompletely understood, but it is probably involved in the modulation of colonic motility and visceral pain in the gut. A number of selective 5-HT3 antagonists have been developed including ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron renzapride and zacopride. While the substituted benzamide prokinetics (for example, metoclopramide, cisapride) also block 5-HT3 receptors in high concentrations, their prokinetic action is believed to be on the basis of their agonist effects on the putative 5-HT4 receptor. Some 5-HT3 antagonists have 5-HT4 agonist activity (for example, renzapride, zacopride) and others do not (for example, ondansetron, granisetron), while tropisetron in high concentrations is a 5-HT4 antagonist. Based on the pharmacological data, it has been suggested that specific 5-HT antagonists and agonists may prove to be beneficial in a number of gastrointestinal disorders including the irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, non-cardiac chest pain, gastrooesophageal reflux and refractory nausea. In this review, the rationale for the use of these compounds is discussed, and the available experimental evidence is summarized.
15606893	Characterization of an allosteric citalopram-binding site at the serotonin transporter.	The serotonin transporter (SERT), which belongs to a family of sodium/chloride-dependent transporters, is the major pharmacological target in the treatment of several clinical disorders, including depression and anxiety. In the present study we show that the dissociation rate, of [3H]S-citalopram from human SERT, is retarded by the presence of serotonin, as well as by several antidepressants, when present in the dissociation buffer. Dissociation of [3H]S-citalopram from SERT is most potently inhibited by S-citalopram followed by R-citalopram, sertraline, serotonin and paroxetine. EC50 values for S- and R-citalopram are 3.6 +/- 0.4 microm and 19.4 +/- 2.3 microm, respectively. Fluoxetine, venlafaxine and duloxetine have no significant effect on the dissociation of [3H]S-citalopram. Allosteric modulation of dissociation is independent of temperature, or the presence of Na+ in the dissociation buffer. Dissociation of [3H]S-citalopram from a complex with the SERT double-mutant, N208Q/N217Q, which has been suggested to be unable to self-assemble into oligomeric complexes, is retarded to an extent similar to that found with the wild-type, raising the possibility that the allosteric mechanism is mediated within a single subunit. A species-scanning mutagenesis study comparing human and bovine SERT revealed that Met180, Tyr495 and Ser513 are important residues in mediating the allosteric effect, as well as contributing to high-affinity binding at the primary site.
23266271	Radioprotection by two phenolic compounds: chlorogenic and quinic acid, on X-ray induced DNA damage in human blood lymphocytes in vitro.	The present study was designed to determine the radioprotective effect of two phytochemicals, namely, quinic acid and chlorogenic acid, against X-ray irradiation-induced genomic instability in non-tumorigenic human blood lymphocytes. The protective ability of two phenolic acids against radiation-induced DNA damage was assessed using the alkaline comet assay in human blood lymphocytes isolated from two healthy human donors. A Siemens Mevatron MD2 (Siemens AG, USA, 1994) linear accelerator was used for irradiation. The results of the alkaline comet assay revealed that quinic acid and chlorogenic acid decreased the DNA damage induced by X-ray irradiation and provided a significant radioprotective effect. Quinic acid decreased the presence of irradiation-induced DNA damage by 5.99-53.57% and chlorogenic acid by 4.49-48.15%, as determined by the alkaline comet assay. The results show that quinic acid and chlorogenic acid may act as radioprotective compounds. Future studies should focus on determining the mechanism by which these phenolic acids provide radioprotection.
15680473	Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide potentiates spinal glutamatergic sympathoexcitation in anesthetized rats.	Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is widely expressed in the rat central nervous system, notably in areas involved in control of autonomic and neuroendocrine functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CART peptide fragment 55-102, referred to herein as CARTp, by intrathecal injection on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) before and after intrathecal glutamate in urethane-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. CARTp (0.1-10 nmol) administered intrathecally caused no or a small, statistically insignificant increase of blood pressure and heart rate, except at the concentration of 10 nmol, which caused a significant increase of blood pressure and heart rate. Intrathecal glutamate (0.1-10 nmol) produced a dose-dependent increase in arterial pressure and heart rate. Pretreatment with CARTp dose-dependently potentiated the pressor effects of glutamate (1 nmol), which by itself elicited a moderate increase of blood pressure and heart rate. Further, CARTp significantly potentiated the tachycardic effect of glutamate at 1 and 5 nmol, but attenuated the response at 10 nmol. The effect of CARTp was long-lasting, as it enhanced glutamatergic responses up to 90 min after administration. Prior injection of CARTp antiserum (1:500) but not normal rabbit serum nullified the potentiating effect of CARTp on glutamatergic responses. The result suggests that CARTp, whose immunoreactivity is detectable in sympathetic preganglionic neurons as well as in fibers projecting into the intermediolateral cell column, augments spinal sympathetic outflow elicited by glutamate at lower concentrations and may directly excite neurons in the intermediolateral cell column at higher concentrations.
10864881	Betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, reduces Na(+) influx into cortical synaptosomes by direct interaction with Na(+) channels: comparison with other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.	Betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist used for the treatment of glaucoma, is known to be neuroprotective in paradigms of ischaemia/excitotoxicity. In this study, we examined whether betaxolol and other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists interact directly with neurotoxin binding to sites 1 and 2 of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Na(+) channel) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes. Betaxolol inhibited specific [(3)H]-batrachotoxinin-A 20-alpha-benzoate ([(3)H]-BTX-B) binding to neurotoxin site 2 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 9.8 microM. Comparison of all the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists tested revealed a potency order of propranolol>betaxolol approximately levobetaxolol>levobunolol approximately carteolol>/=timolol>atenolol. None of the drugs caused a significant inhibition of [(3)H]-saxitoxin binding to neurotoxin receptor site 1, even at concentrations as high as 250 microM. Saturation experiments showed that betaxolol increased the K(D) of [(3)H]-BTX-B binding but had no effect on the B(max). The association kinetics of [(3)H]-BTX-B were unaffected by betaxolol, but the drug significantly accelerated the dissociation rate of the radioligand. These findings argue for a competitive, indirect, allosteric mode of inhibition of [(3)H]-BTX-B binding by betaxolol. Betaxolol inhibited veratridine-stimulated Na(+) influx in rat cortical synaptosomes with an IC(50) value of 28. 3 microM. Carteolol, levobunolol, timolol and atenolol were significantly less effective than betaxolol at reducing veratridine-evoked Na(+) influx. The ability of betaxolol to interact with neurotoxin site 2 of the Na(+) channel and inhibit Na(+) influx may have a role in its neuroprotective action in paradigms of excitotoxicity/ischaemia and in its therapeutic effect in glaucoma.
11078056	Biochemistry of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors and molecular pathology of COX-2 in neoplasia.	Several types of human tumors overexpress cyclooxygenase (COX) -2 but not COX-1, and gene knockout transfection experiments demonstrate a central role of COX-2 in experimental tumorigenesis. COX-2 produces prostaglandins that inhibit apoptosis and stimulate angiogenesis and invasiveness. Selective COX-2 inhibitors reduce prostaglandin synthesis, restore apoptosis, and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. In animal studies they limit carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. In contrast, aspirin-like nonselective NSAIDs such as sulindac and indomethacin inhibit not only the enzymatic action of the highly inducible, proinflammatory COX-2 but the constitutively expressed, cytoprotective COX-1 as well. Consequently, nonselective NSAIDs can cause platelet dysfunction, gastrointestinal ulceration, and kidney damage. For that reason, selective inhibition of COX-2 to treat neoplastic proliferation is preferable to nonselective inhibition. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as meloxicam, celecoxib (SC-58635), and rofecoxib (MK-0966), are NSAIDs that have been modified chemically to preferentially inhibit COX-2 but not COX-1. For instance, meloxicam inhibits the growth of cultured colon cancer cells (HCA-7 and Moser-S) that express COX-2 but has no effect on HCT-116 tumor cells that do not express COX-2. NS-398 induces apoptosis in COX-2 expressing LNCaP prostate cancer cells and, surprisingly, in colon cancer S/KS cells that does not express COX-2. This effect may due to induction of apoptosis through uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and down-regulation of Bcl-2, as has been demonstrated for some nonselective NSAIDs, for instance, flurbiprofen. COX-2 mRNA and COX-2 protein is constitutively expressed in the kidney, brain, spinal cord, and ductus deferens, and in the uterus during implantation. In addition, COX-2 is constitutively and dominantly expressed in the pancreatic islet cells. These findings might somewhat limit the use of presently available selective COX-2 inhibitors in cancer prevention but will probably not deter their successful application for the treatment of human cancers.
9145928	Study of the interaction between aryloxypropanolamines and Asn386 in helix VII of the human 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor.	We studied the stereoselective interaction between aryloxypropanolamines and the human 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor. R- and S-enantiomers of propranolol, penbutolol, and alprenolol were investigated for their ability to bind to human 5-HT1A wild-type and Asn386Val mutant receptors. Asn386 seemed to act as a chiral discriminator. Although both aryloxypropanol enantiomers displayed lower affinity for the mutant receptors, the affinities for the S-enantiomers were more affected. Receptor affinities of other structurally unrelated 5-HT1A ligands were not decreased by the mutation of Asn386 to valine. In addition, a series of analogues of propranolol with structural variation in the oxypropanolamine moiety was synthesized, and affinities for wild-type and Asn386Val mutant 5-HT1A receptors were determined. Both the hydroxyl and the ether oxygen atoms of the oxypropanol moiety seem to be required for binding at wild-type 5-HT1A receptors. The hydroxyl group of propranolol probably directly interacts with Asn386. The ether oxygen atom may be important for steric reasons but can also be involved in a direct interaction with Asn386. These findings are in agreement with the interactions of aryloxypropanolamines with Asn386 in rat 5-HT1A receptors that we previously proposed. The loss of affinity for propranolol by the Asn386Val mutation could be regained by replacement of the hydroxyl group of the ligand by a methoxy group. This modification of the propranolol structure has no effect on the affinity of both enantiomers for the wild-type 5-HT1A receptor, which provides an alternative hypothesis for the interaction of Asn386 with the oxypropanol oxygen atoms. According to this novel hypothesis, the oxypropanol oxygen atoms may both act as hydrogen bond acceptors from the NH2 group of Asn386.
23493374	Creb1-Mecp2-(m)CpG complex transactivates postnatal murine neuronal glucose transporter isoform 3 expression.	The murine neuronal facilitative glucose transporter isoform 3 (Glut3) is developmentally regulated, peaking in expression at postnatal day (PN)14. In the present study, we characterized a canonical CpG island spanning the 5'-flanking region of the glut3 gene. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing identified methylation of this CpG ((m)CpG) island of the glut3 gene, frequency of methylation increasing 2.5-fold with a 1.6-fold increase in DNA methyl transferase 3a concentrations noted with advancing postnatal age (PN14 vs PN3). 5'-flanking region of glut3-luciferase reporter transient transfection in HT22 hippocampal neurons demonstrated that (m)CpGs inhibit glut3 transcription. Contrary to this biological function, glut3 expression rises synchronously with (m)CpGs in PN14 vs PN3 neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) bound the glut3-(m)CpGs. Depending on association with specific coregulators, Mecp2, a dual regulator of gene transcription, may repress or activate a downstream gene. Sequential chromatin IP uncovered the glut3-(m)CpGs to bind Mecp2 exponentially upon recruitment of Creb1 rather than histone deacetylase 1. Co-IP and coimmunolocalization confirmed that Creb1 associated with Mecp2 and cotransfection with glut3-(m)CpG in HT22 cells enhanced glut3 transcription. Separate 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine pretreatment or in combination with trichostatin A reduced (m)CpG and specific small interference RNAs targeting Mecp2 and Creb1 separately or together depleting Mecp2 and/or Creb1 binding of glut3-(m)CpGs reduced glut3 expression in HT22 cells. We conclude that Glut3 is a methylation-sensitive neuronal gene that recruits Mecp2. Recruitment of Creb1-Mecp2 by glut3-(m)CpG contributes towards transactivation, formulating an escape from (m)CpG-induced gene suppression, and thereby promoting developmental neuronal glut3 gene transcription and expression.
15126366	Characterization of the interaction of ingenol 3-angelate with protein kinase C.	Ingenol 3-angelate (I3A) is one of the active ingredients in Euphorbia peplus, which has been used in traditional medicine. Here, we report the initial characterization of I3A as a protein kinase C (PKC) ligand. I3A bound to PKC-alpha in the presence of phosphatidylserine with high affinity; however, under these assay conditions, little PKC isoform selectivity was observed. PKC isoforms did show different sensitivity and selectivity for down-regulation by I3A and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in WEHI-231, HOP-92, and Colo-205 cells. In all of the three cell types, I3A inhibited cell proliferation with somewhat lower potency than did PMA. In intact CHO-K1 cells, I3A was able to translocate different green fluorescent protein-tagged PKC isoforms, visualized by confocal microscopy, with equal or higher potency than PMA. PKC-delta in particular showed a different pattern of translocation in response to I3A and PMA. I3A induced a higher level of secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 compared with PMA in the WEHI-231 cells and displayed a marked biphasic dose-response curve for the induction. I3A was unable to cause the same extent of association of the C1b domain of PKC-delta with lipids, compared with PMA or the physiological regulator diacylglycerol, and was able to partially block the association induced by these agents, measured by surface plasmon resonance. The in vitro kinase activity of PKC-alpha induced by I3A was lower than that induced by PMA. The novel pattern of behavior of I3A makes it of great interest for further evaluation.
23301860	Single-walled carbon nanotube surface control of complement recognition and activation.	Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are receiving considerable attention in site-specific drug and nucleic acid delivery, photodynamic therapy, and photoacoustic molecular imaging. Despite these advances, nanotubes may activate the complement system (an integral part of innate immunity), which can induce clinically significant anaphylaxis. We demonstrate that single-walled CNTs coated with human serum albumin activate the complement system through C1q-mediated classical and the alternative pathways. Surface coating with methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-based amphiphiles, which confers solubility and prolongs circulation profiles of CNTs, activates the complement system differently, depending on the amphiphile structure. CNTs with linear poly(ethylene glycol) amphiphiles trigger the lectin pathway of the complement through both L-ficolin and mannan-binding lectin recognition. The lectin pathway activation, however, did not trigger the amplification loop of the alternative pathway. An amphiphile with branched poly(ethylene glycol) architecture also activated the lectin pathway but only through L-ficolin recognition. Importantly, this mode of activation neither generated anaphylatoxins nor induced triggering of the effector arm of the complement system. These observations provide a major step toward nanomaterial surface modification with polymers that have the properties to significantly improve innate immunocompatibility by limiting the formation of complement C3 and C5 convertases.
23363575	TCDD and corticosterone on testicular steroidogenesis and antioxidant system of epididymal sperm in rats.	2,3,7,8-Tetrachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an endocrine-disrupting environmental pollutant, has been found to cause male reproductive toxicity. Glucocorticoids have been found to influence the metabolic pathway of TCDD. Stress, which affects the male reproductive function, is marked by an increase in the level and activity of glucocorticoids in the body. The present study was carried out to understand the effect of TCDD on testicular steroidogenesis and sperm antioxidant system under the influence of increased level of corticosterone in the body. Adult male rats were treated with either TCDD (100 ng/kg bw/ day) or corticosterone (3 mg/kg bw/day) or both for 15 days. Treatment with either TCDD or corticosterone was found to suppress the levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and androgen-binding protein and reduce the activities of steroidogenic enzymes in testis while increasing oxidative stress in ventral prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymal sperm. In rats treated with both TCDD and corticosterone, the suppression of testicular steroidogenesis and increase in oxidative stress observed in ventral prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymal sperm were significant as compared to TCDD alone treated rats. The levels of Fas and FasL proteins were also increased in rats subjected to either TCDD or corticosterone treatment. In rats treated with both compounds, the increase observed in testicular levels of Fas and FasL was significant as compared to TCDD alone treated rats. Effect of TCDD on testicular steroidogenesis and antioxidant system of epididymal sperm may get enhanced under increased level of glucocorticoids in the body.
23349524	The role of GH in adipose tissue: lessons from adipose-specific GH receptor gene-disrupted mice.	GH receptor (GHR) gene-disrupted mice (GHR-/-) have provided countless discoveries as to the numerous actions of GH. Many of these discoveries highlight the importance of GH in adipose tissue. For example GHR-/- mice are insulin sensitive yet obese with preferential enlargement of the sc adipose depot. GHR-/- mice also have elevated levels of leptin, resistin, and adiponectin, compared with controls leading some to suggest that GH may negatively regulate certain adipokines. To help clarify the role that GH exerts specifically on adipose tissue in vivo, we selectively disrupted GHR in adipose tissue to produce Fat GHR Knockout (FaGHRKO) mice. Surprisingly, FaGHRKOs shared only a few characteristics with global GHR-/- mice. Like the GHR-/- mice, FaGHRKO mice are obese with increased total body fat and increased adipocyte size. However, FaGHRKO mice have increases in all adipose depots with no improvements in measures of glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, resistin and adiponectin levels in FaGHRKO mice are similar to controls (or slightly decreased) unlike the increased levels found in GHR-/- mice, suggesting that GH does not regulate these adipokines directly in adipose tissue in vivo. Other features of FaGHRKO mice include decreased levels of adipsin, a near-normal GH/IGF-1 axis, and minimal changes to a large assortment of circulating factors that were measured such as IGF-binding proteins. In conclusion, specific removal of GHR in adipose tissue is sufficient to increase adipose tissue and decrease circulating adipsin. However, removal of GHR in adipose tissue alone is not sufficient to increase levels of resistin or adiponectin and does not alter glucose metabolism.
23410798	Spiro heterocycles as potential inhibitors of SIRT1: Pd/C-mediated synthesis of novel N-indolylmethyl spiroindoline-3,2'-quinazolines.	Novel N-indolylmethyl substituted spiroindoline-3,2'-quinazolines were designed as potential inhibitiors of SIRT1. These compounds were synthesized in good yields by using Pd/C-Cu mediated coupling-cyclization strategy as a key step involving the reaction of 1-(prop-2-ynyl)-1'H-spiro[indoline-3,2'-quinazoline]-2,4'(3'H)-dione with 2-iodoanilides. Some of the compounds synthesized have shown encouraging inhibition of Sir 2 protein (a yeast homologue of mammalian SIRT1) in vitro and three of them showed dose dependent inhibition of Sir 2. The docking results suggested that the benzene ring of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin ring system of these molecules occupied the deep hydrophobic pocket of the protein and one of the NH along with the sulfonyl group participated in strong H-bonding interaction with the amino acid residues.
17662248	Stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors modulates Jurkat T cell growth and adhesion to fibronectin.	The aims of this study were to investigate the expression and the functional roles of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in leukemic Jurkat T cells. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy analysis showed that Jurkat T cells express the NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptors. Exposure of Jurkat cells to either (5S,10R)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,b]cyclohepten-5,10-imine [(+)-MK 801] or D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), two selective NMDA receptor antagonists, limited cell growth by inhibiting cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis, whereas l-glutamate (1 microM) and NMDA (10 microM) significantly increased (137.2+/-22.0%; P<0.01) Jurkat T cell adhesion to fibronectin. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Jurkat T cells express NMDA receptors functionally active in controlling cell growth and adhesion to fibronectin.
12826271	Diclofenac inhibits proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells.	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in clinical situations as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic drugs. However, it is still unknown whether NSAIDs have effects on the development of the central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated the effects of NSAIDs on neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation into neurons. In contrast to aspirin, naproxen, indomethacin and ibuprofen, treatment with diclofenac (10 microM) for 2 days induced the death of NSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. Diclofenac also inhibited the proliferation of NSCs and their differentiation into neurons. Treatment with diclofenac resulted in nuclear condensation (a morphological change due to apoptosis of NSCs) 24hr after the treatment and activated caspase-3 after 6 hr, indicating that diclofenac may cause apoptosis of neuronal cells via activation of the caspase cascade. These results suggest that diclofenac may affect the development of the central nervous system.
16617454	Airway inflammation in asymptomatic children with episodic wheeze.	Airway pathologies have been comprehensively researched in adult asthma, but in children, the extent of airway inflammation associated with episodic wheeze, often diagnosed as asthma, has not been fully characterized. It is not clear whether persistent airway inflammation is present in the absence of wheezing symptoms, and there is controversy regarding the role of age and atopy. This study assessed cellular and cytokine markers of airway inflammation in asymptomatic children with a history of episodic wheeze. Children with a history of episodic wheeze and cough (study group) and nonasthmatic patients requiring elective surgery (control group) were recruited. All subjects in the study group had a history of significant episodic wheezing (>2 episodes per year), and used only as-needed beta-agonist treatment. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was obtained using bronchoscopic lavage (study group) and nonbronchoscopic lavage (control group). Differential cell counts of BAL and flow cytometry were performed to identify T-lymphocyte phenotypes, and intracellular cytokine profiles were measured after phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation of BAL fluid T-cells. Twenty-one children with a history of 2-12 episodes of wheeze per year and 21 nonasthmatic subjects without respiratory symptoms were recruited. Study and control subjects were matched for age (median age, 5 years) and demographic characteristics. Study subjects had higher IgE levels, but their measurements were still within normal range. No significant differences in BAL differential cell counts were noted, and in both groups, the majority of T-cells were CD3+ CD8+, with a median CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.6. There was no significant difference in T-cell expression of the activation markers HLA-DR and CD25 (IL-2 receptor), or in PMA-induced production of the intracellular cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. The results of this study suggest that significant T-cell-driven airway inflammation is absent in mild or nonatopic, asymptomatic children of this age group who have episodic wheeze. Our findings support asthma management guidelines that do not recommend long-term treatment of this group of patients with anti-inflammatory medications.
11422746	Fibroblast growth factor receptors and their ligands in the adult rat kidney.	BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of at least 21 heparin-binding proteins involved in many biological processes, both during development and in the adult, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis. FGFs mediate their effects through high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs), which are encoded by four genes. The aims of the present study were to localize FGFR-1 through FGFR-3 in the normal adult rat kidney and to determine which functional FGFR variants and FGFs were expressed. METHODS: Avidin-biotin-enhanced horseradish peroxidase immunohistochemistry was used on paraffin sections of rat kidney to localize FGFR-1 through FGFR-3, whereas reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to examine expression of the receptor variants and also of FGF-1 through FGF-10 in cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla. RESULTS: By immunohistochemistry, each receptor was localized to distinct and overlapping nephron segments, such that one or more FGFRs were localized to all nephron and collecting duct epithelia. FGFR-1 and FGFR-3 were localized to glomeruli, FGFR-3 to proximal tubules and FGFR-1 to thin limbs. FGFR-1 through FGFR-3 were localized to distal straight tubules, with FGFR-1 and FGFR-3 localized to distal convoluted tubules. FGFR-1 and FGFR-3 were localized to medullary collecting ducts. In addition, FGFR-1 was localized to the smooth muscle of renal arteries. All seven FGFR variants were expressed in the cortex and outer medulla, with fewer FGFRs in the inner medulla. FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-7, FGF-8, and FGF-9 were expressed in the kidney, with FGF-10 expression found only in the cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Mapping of these receptors is critical to the determination of the effects of FGF ligands in discrete regions of the kidney. The distributions of the FGFRs in the normal adult kidney and the restricted expression of FGF ligands suggest that specific FGFs have distinct and important roles in the maintenance of normal kidney structure and function.
23639192	Puerarin stimulates proliferation and differentiation and protects against cell death in human osteoblastic MG-63 cells via ER-dependent MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt activation.	Puerarin, the main isoflavone glycoside found in the Chinese herb radix of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, has received increasing attention because of its possible role in the prevention of osteoporosis. Previously, we showed that puerarin could inhibit the bone absorption of osteoclasts and promote long bone growth in fetal mouse in vitro. Further study confirmed that puerarin stimulated proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts in rat. However, the mechanisms underlying its actions on human bone cells have not been well defined. Here we show that puerarin increases proliferation and differentiation and opposes cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human osteoblastic MG-63 cells containing two estrogen receptor (ER) isoforms. Puerarin promotes proliferation by altering cell cycle distribution whereas puerarin-mediated survival may be associated with up-regulation of Bcl-xL expression. Treatment with the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 abolishes the above actions of puerarin on osteoblast-derived cells. Using small interfering double-stranded RNA technology, we further demonstrate that the effects of puerarin on proliferation, differentiation and survival are mediated by both ERα and ERβ. Moreover, we also demonstrate that puerarin functions at least partially through activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling. This agent also shows much weaker effect on breast epithelial cell growth than that of estrogen. Therefore, puerarin will be a promising agent that prevents or retards osteoporosis.
23301766	Improved self-healing of polyethylene/carbon black nanocomposites by their shape memory effect.	In this work, the improved self-healing of cross-linked polyethylene (PE) (cPE)/carbon black (CB) nanocomposites by their shape memory effect (SME) is investigated. CB nanoparticles are found to be homogeneously dispersed in the PE matrix and significantly increase the strength of the materials. Compared with the breaking of linear PE (lPE) at the melting temperature (T(m)), the cPE and cPE/CB nanocomposites still have high strength above T(m) due to the formation of networks. The cPE and cPE/CB nanocomposites show both high strain fixity ratio (R(f)) and high strain recovery ratio (R(r)). Crystallization-induced elongation is observed for all the prepared shape memory polymer (SMP) materials and the effect becomes less remarkable with increasing volume fraction of CB nanoparticles (v(CB)). The scratch self-healing tests show that the cross-linking of PE matrix, the addition of CB nanoparticles, and the previous stretching in the direction perpendicular to the scratch favor the closure of the scratch and its complete healing. This SME-aided self-healing could have potential applications in diverse fields such as coating and structure materials.
16474853	Preclinical and clinical development of the oral multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in cancer treatment.	Tumor survival, growth and metastasis depend on efficient tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis, and targeting both of these processes simultaneously could prove to be therapeutically relevant. The RAS/RAF signaling pathway is an important mediator of tumor cell proliferation, and angiogenesis and is often aberrantly activated in human tumors due to the presence of activated Ras or mutant B-Raf, or elevation of growth factor receptors. Sorafenib, which belongs chemically to a class that can be described as bis-aryl ureas, was selected for further pharmacologic characterization based on potent inhibition of Raf-1 and its favorable kinase selectivity profile. Further characterization showed that sorafenib suppresses both wild-type and V599E mutant B-Raf activity in vitro. In addition, sorafenib demonstrated significant activity against several receptor tyrosine kinases involved in neovascularization and tumor progression, including vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)-2, VEGFR-3, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR)-beta Flt-3, and c-KIT. Preclinically, sorafenib showed broad-spectrum antitumor activity in colon, breast and non-small-cell lung cancer xenograft models. A total of four phase I studies using oral sorafenib as a single agent have been completed, and the compound showed a favorable safety profile with mild to moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event. The maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg b.i.d. continuous. Single-agent phase II trials reported so far demonstrated antitumor activity of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcoma and renal cell cancer (RCC). Based on phase II results in RCC patients, a placebo-controlled phase III study was performed, which randomized a total of 905 patients, most of whom were treated previously. The partial response rate was 2% for sorafenib and 0% for placebo. Stable disease was observed in 78% and 55% of patients on sorafenib and placebo, respectively. Sorafenib significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (24 weeks) compared with placebo (12 weeks) in all subsets of patients evaluated. Approval of sorafenib by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication is pending. A first-line phase III study in RCC as well as phase III studies in hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic melanoma have been initiated.
22750078	The novel phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor THPP-1 has antipsychotic-like effects in rat and improves cognition in rat and rhesus monkey.	Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is a novel target for the treatment of schizophrenia that may address multiple symptomatic domains associated with this disorder. PDE10A is highly expressed in the brain and functions to metabolically inactivate the important second messengers cAMP and cGMP. Here we describe effects of a potent and orally bioavailable PDE10A inhibitor [2-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)-4-(2-methoxyethoxy)-7,8-dihydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-6(5H)-yl](imidazo[1,5-a]pyridin-1-yl)methanone] (THPP-1) on striatal signaling pathways, in behavioral tests that predict antipsychotic potential, and assays that measure episodic-like memory in rat and executive function in rhesus monkey. THPP-1 exhibits nanomolar potency on the PDE10A enzyme, demonstrates excellent pharmacokinetic properties in multiple preclinical animal species, and is selective for PDE10A over other PDE families of enzymes. THPP-1 significantly increased phosphorylation of proteins in the striatum involved in synaptic plasticity, including the a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid receptor (AMPA) GluR1 subunit, extracellular receptor kinase (ERK), and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). THPP-1 produced dose-dependent effects in preclinical assays predictive of antipsychotic activity including attenuation of MK-801-induced psychomotor activation and condition avoidance responding in rats. At similar plasma exposures, THPP-1 significantly increased object recognition memory in rat and attenuated a ketamine-induced deficit in the object retrieval detour task in rhesus monkey. These findings suggest that PDE10A inhibitors have the potential to impact multiple symptomatic domains of schizophrenia including positive symptoms and cognitive impairment.

12407077	Probing an open CFTR pore with organic anion blockers.	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion channel that conducts Cl- current. We explored the CFTR pore by studying voltage-dependent blockade of the channel by two organic anions: glibenclamide and isethionate. To simplify the kinetic analysis, a CFTR mutant, K1250A-CFTR, was used because this mutant channel, once opened, can remain open for minutes. Dose-response relationships of both blockers follow a simple Michaelis-Menten function with K(d) values that differ by three orders of magnitude. Glibenclamide blocks CFTR from the intracellular side of the membrane with slow kinetics. Both the on and off rates of glibenclamide block are voltage dependent. Removing external Cl- increases affinity of glibenclamide due to a decrease of the off rate and an increase of the on rate, suggesting the presence of a Cl- binding site external to the glibenclamide binding site. Isethionate blocks the channel from the cytoplasmic side with fast kinetics, but has no measurable effect when applied extracellularly. Increasing the internal Cl- concentration reduces isethionate block without affecting its voltage dependence, suggesting that Cl- and isethionate compete for a binding site in the pore. The voltage dependence and external Cl- concentration dependence of isethionate block are nearly identical to those of glibenclamide block, suggesting that these two blockers may bind to a common binding site, an idea further supported by kinetic studies of blocking with glibenclamide/isethionate mixtures. By comparing the physical and chemical natures of these two blockers, we propose that CFTR channel has an asymmetric pore with a wide internal entrance and a deeply embedded blocker binding site where local charges as well as hydrophobic components determine the affinity of the blockers.
23583258	Phenolic compounds present in Sardinian wine extracts protect against the production of inflammatory cytokines induced by oxysterols in CaCo-2 human enterocyte-like cells.	Cholesterol auto-oxidation products, namely oxysterols, are widely present in cholesterol-rich foods. They are thought to potentially interfere with homeostasis of the human digestive tract, playing a role in intestinal mucosal damage. This report concerns the marked up-regulation in differentiated CaCo-2 colonic epithelial cells of two key inflammatory interleukins, IL-6 and IL-8, caused by a mixture of oxysterols representative of a high cholesterol diet. This strong pro-inflammatory effect appeared to be dependent on the net imbalance of red-ox equilibrium with the production of excessive levels of reactive oxygen species through the colonic NADPH-oxidase NOX1 activation. Induction of NOX1 was markedly while not fully inhibited by CaCo-2 cell pre-incubation with phenolic extracts obtained from well-selected wines from typical grape varieties grown in Sardinia. Oxysterol-dependent NOX1 activation, as well as interleukin synthesis, were completely prevented by Cannonau red wine extract that contains an abundant phenolic fraction, in particular phenolic acids and flavonoids. Conversely, cell pre-treatment with Vermentino white wine extract with smaller phenolic fraction showed only a partial NOX1 down-regulation and was ineffective in interleukin synthesis induced by dietary oxysterols. It is thus likely that the effects of Sardinian wine extracts against intestinal inflammation induced by dietary oxysterols are mainly due to their high phenolic content: low doses of phenolics would be responsible only for direct scavenging oxysterol-dependent ROS production. Besides this direct activity, an excess of phenolic compounds detectable in red wine, may exert an additional indirect action by blocking oxysterol-related NOX1 induction, thus totally preventing the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory events triggered by dietary oxysterols.
16897483	Two highly divergent alcohol dehydrogenases of melon exhibit fruit ripening-specific expression and distinct biochemical characteristics.	Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) participate in the biosynthetic pathway of aroma volatiles in fruit by interconverting aldehydes to alcohols and providing substrates for the formation of esters. Two highly divergent ADH genes (15% identity at the amino acid level) of Cantaloupe Charentais melon (Cucumis melo var. Cantalupensis) have been isolated. Cm-ADH1 belongs to the medium-chain zinc-binding type of ADHs and is highly similar to all ADH genes expressed in fruit isolated so far. Cm-ADH2 belongs to the short-chain type of ADHs. The two encoded proteins are enzymatically active upon expression in yeast. Cm-ADH1 has strong preference for NAPDH as a co-factor, whereas Cm-ADH2 preferentially uses NADH. Both Cm-ADH proteins are much more active as reductases with K (m)s 10-20 times lower for the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols than for the dehydrogenation of alcohols to aldehydes. They both show strong preference for aliphatic aldehydes but Cm-ADH1 is capable of reducing branched aldehydes such as 3-methylbutyraldehyde, whereas Cm-ADH2 cannot. Both Cm-ADH genes are expressed specifically in fruit and up-regulated during ripening. Gene expression as well as total ADH activity are strongly inhibited in antisense ACC oxidase melons and in melon fruit treated with the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), indicating a positive regulation by ethylene. These data suggest that each of the Cm-ADH protein plays a specific role in the regulation of aroma biosynthesis in melon fruit.
23603339	Dehydroepiandrosterone post-transcriptionally modifies CYP1A2 induction involving androgen receptor.	The pharmacological dosage of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) protects against chemically induced carcinogenesis. The chemoprotective activity of DHEA is attributed to its inhibitory potential for the expression of CYP1A enzymes, which are highly responsible for metabolic activation of several mutagenic and carcinogenic chemicals. The present work investigated whether the chemoprevention by DHEA was due to diminished transcriptional activation of CYP1A genes or to the post-transcriptional modulation of CYP1A expression. In primary human hepatocytes, DHEA diminished the increase in CYP1A activities (7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation and phenacetin O-dealkylation) and in CYP1A2 mRNA level induced by 3-methylcholanthrene, but did not alter the amount of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA. The androgen receptor seemed to be involved in DHEA-mediated diminishment of CYP1A2 induction, which was attenuated in the presence of bicalutamide, the androgen receptor antagonist. The potential role of the glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor in DHEA-mediated decrease in CYP1A2 induction was excluded. The developed computational model of CYP1A2 induction kinetics and CYP1A2 mRNA degradation proposed that a post-transcriptional mechanism was likely to be the primary mechanism of the DHEA-mediated diminishment of CYP1A2 induction. The hypothesis was confirmed by the results of actinomycin D-chase experiments in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, displaying that the degradation rates of CYP1A2 mRNA were significantly higher in the cells exposed to DHEA. The novel findings on DHEA-mediated modulation of CYP1A2 mRNA stability may account for the beneficial effects of DHEA by decreasing the metabolic activation of pro-carcinogenic compounds.
12421359	Study of the nematode putative GABA type-A receptor subunits: evidence for modulation by ivermectin.	Two alleles of the HG1 gene, which encodes a putative GABA receptor alpha/gamma subunit, were isolated from Haemonchus contortus. These two alleles were shown previously to be associated with ivermectin susceptibility (HG1A) and resistance (HG1E), respectively. Sequence analysis indicates that they differ in four amino acids. To explore the functional properties of the two alleles, a full-length cDNA encoding the beta subunit, a key functional component of the GABA receptor, was isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans (gab-1, corresponding to the GenBank locus ZC482.1) and coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes with the HG1 alleles. When gab-1 was coexpressed with either the HG1A allele or the HG1E allele in Xenopus oocytes, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-responsive channels with different sensitivity to the agonist were formed. The effects of ivermectin on the hetero-oligomeric receptors were determined. Application of ivermectin alone had no effect on the receptors. However, when coapplied with 10 micro m GABA, ivermectin potentiated the GABA-evoked current of the GAB-1/HG1A receptor, but attenuated the GABA response of the GAB-1/HG1E receptor. We demonstrated that the coexpressed HG1 and GAB-1 receptors are GABA-responsive, and provide evidence for the possible involvement of GABA receptors in the mechanism of ivermectin resistance.
23207409	Combining QSAR classification models for predictive modeling of human monoamine oxidase inhibitors.	Due to their role in the metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitters, MAO-A and MAO-B present a significant pharmacological interest. For instance the inhibitors of human MAO-B are considered useful tools for the treatment of Parkinson Disease. Therefore, the rational design and synthesis of new MAOs inhibitors is considered of great importance for the development of new and more effective treatments of Parkinson Disease. In this work, Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) has been developed to predict the human MAO inhibitory activity and selectivity. The first step was the selection of a suitable dataset of heterocyclic compounds that include chromones, coumarins, chalcones, thiazolylhydrazones, etc. These compounds were previously synthesized in one of our laboratories, or elsewhere, and their activities measured by the same assays and for the same laboratory staff. Applying linear discriminant analysis to data derived from a variety of molecular representations and feature selection algorithms, reliable QSAR models were built which could be used to predict for test compounds the inhibitory activity and selectivity toward human MAO. This work also showed how several QSAR models can be combined to make better predictions. The final models exhibit significant statistics, interpretability, as well as displaying predictive power on an external validation set made up of chromone derivatives with unknown activity (that are being reported here for first time) synthesized by our group, and coumarins recently reported in the literature.
23395171	Tmem64 modulates calcium signaling during RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation.	Osteoclast maturation and function primarily depend on receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-mediated induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), which is further activated via increased intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) oscillation. However, the coordination mechanism that mediates Ca(2+) oscillation during osteoclastogenesis remains ill defined. Here, we identified transmembrane protein 64 (Tmem64) as a regulator of Ca(2+) oscillation during osteoclastogenesis. We found that Tmem64-deficient mice exhibit increased bone mass due in part to impaired osteoclast formation. Using in vitro osteoclast culture systems, we show here that Tmem64 interacts with sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2 (SERCA2) and modulates its activity. Consequently, Tmem64 deficiency significantly diminishes RANKL-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillation, which results in reduced Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) IV and mitochondrial ROS, both of which contribute to achieving the CREB activity necessary for osteoclast formation. These data demonstrate that Tmem64 is a positive modulator of osteoclast differentiation via SERCA2-dependent Ca(2+) signaling.
23073075	Fingolimod protects cultured cortical neurons against excitotoxic death.	Fingolimod (FTY720), a novel drug approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, activates different sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) subtypes. Its primary mechanism of action is to reduce the egress of T lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs, thus restraining neuroinflammation and autoimmunity. However, recent evidence suggests that the action of FTY720 involves S1PRs expressed by cells resident in the CNS, including neurons. Here, we examined the effect of FTY720, its active metabolite, FTY720-P, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) on neuronal viability using a classical in vitro model of excitotoxic neuronal death. Mixed cultures of mouse cortical cells were challenged with toxic concentrations of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) for 10 min, and neuronal death was assessed 20 h later. FTY720, FTY720-P, and S1P were all neuroprotective when applied 18-20 h prior to the NMDA pulse. Neuroprotection was attenuated by pertussis toxin, and inhibited by the selective type-1 S1PR (S1P1R) antagonist, W146, and by inhibitors of the mitogen associated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PtdIns-3-K) pathways. Both FTY720 and FTY720-P retained their protective activity in pure cultures of mouse or rat cortical neurons. These data offer the first direct demonstration that FTY720 and its active metabolite protect neurons against excitotoxic death.
23131798	Discovery of novel cannabinoid receptor ligands by a virtual screening approach: further development of 2,4,6-trisubstituted 1,3,5-triazines as CB2 agonists.	3D ligand-based virtual screening was employed to identify novel scaffolds for cannabinoid receptor ligand development. A total of 112 compounds with diverse structures were purchased from commercial vendors. 12 CB1 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists and 10 CB2 receptor agonists were identified in vitro. One of the CB2 agonists, N-cyclopentyl-4-ethoxy-6-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (19, -logEC(50)=7.5, E(max)=255%) was selected for further development. As far as we are aware, the compound's 1,3,5-triazine scaffold represents a new core structure for CB2 agonists. A library of fifty-seven 2,4,6-trisubstituted-1,3,5-triazines was created to clarify the structure-activity relationship study of the analogs.
23530959	Multipart Copolyelectrolyte Adhesive of the Sandcastle Worm, Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes): Catechol Oxidase Catalyzed Curing through Peptidyl-DOPA.	Tube-building sabellariid polychaetes have major impacts on the geology and ecology of shorelines worldwide. Sandcastle worms, Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes), live along the western coast of North America. Individual sabellariid worms build tubular shells by gluing together mineral particles with a multipart polyelectrolytic adhesive. Distinct sets of oppositely charged components are packaged and stored in concentrated granules in separate cell types. Homogeneous granules contain sulfated macromolecules as counter-polyanion to polycationic Pc2 and Pc5 proteins, which become major components of the fully cured glue. Heterogeneous granules contain polyphosphoproteins, Pc3A/B, paired with divalent cations and polycationic Pc1 and Pc4 proteins. Both types of granules contain catechol oxidase that catalyzes oxidative cross-linking of L-DOPA. Co-secretion of catechol oxidase guarantees rapid and spatially homogeneous curing with limited mixing of the preassembled adhesive packets. Catechol oxidase remains active long after the glue is fully cured, perhaps providing an active cue for conspecific larval settlement.
23085435	Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells via inhibition of Ras signaling pathways and Bim-mediated activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.	Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) induce apoptosis in tumor cells by inhibiting the prenylation of small G-proteins. However, the details of the apoptosis-inducing mechanism remain obscure. The present study showed that the induction of apoptosis by N-BPs in hematopoietic tumor cells is mediated by mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways, which are activated by the suppression of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) biosynthesis. Furthermore, N-BPs decreased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mTOR via suppression of Ras prenylation and enhanced Bim expression. The present results indicated that N-BPs induce apoptosis by decreasing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increasing the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and enhancing Bim expression through inhibition of the Ras/MEK/ERK and Ras/mTOR pathways. The accumulation of N-BPs in bones suggests that they may act more effectively on tumors that have spread to bones or on Ras-variable tumors. This is the first study to show that the specific molecular pathways of N-BP-induced apoptosis.
15114505	In vitro inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase by prenylflavonoids from Sophora flavescens.	Four prenylflavonoids, kurarinone ( 1), a chalcone of 1, kuraridin ( 2), kurarinol ( 3), kushenol H ( 4) and kushenol K ( 5) isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens were investigated for their inhibitory effects on diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). The flavonoids inhibited DGAT activity in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 10.9 microM ( 1), 9.8 microM ( 2), 8.6 microM ( 3), 142.0 microM ( 4) and 250 microM ( 5). The prenylflavonoids without C3-OH ( 1, 2, 3) showed stronger inhibition than those with C3-OH ( 4, 5). On the other hand, flavonoids without side chains (hesperetin, naringenin, quercetin and kaempferol) did not inhibit the enzyme activity at a final concentration of 800 microM. These data suggest that the lavandulyl side chain and the position of the hydroxy group are important for high DGAT inhibitory activity. Compound 1 also inhibited de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol (TG) in Raji cells.
23200945	Bradykinetic alcohol dehydrogenases make yeast fitter for growth in the presence of allyl alcohol.	Previous studies showed that fitter yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that can grow by fermenting glucose in the presence of allyl alcohol, which is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADH1) to toxic acrolein, had mutations in the ADH1 gene that led to decreased ADH activity. These yeast may grow more slowly due to slower reduction of acetaldehyde and a higher NADH/NAD(+) ratio, which should decrease the oxidation of allyl alcohol. We determined steady-state kinetic constants for three yeast ADHs with new site-directed substitutions and examined the correlation between catalytic efficiency and growth on selective media of yeast expressing six different ADHs. The H15R substitution (a test for electrostatic effects) is on the surface of ADH and has small effects on the kinetics. The H44R substitution (affecting interactions with the coenzyme pyrophosphate) was previously shown to decrease affinity for coenzymes 2-4-fold and turnover numbers (V/Et) by 4-6-fold. The W82R substitution is distant from the active site, but decreases turnover numbers by 5-6-fold, perhaps by effects on protein dynamics. The E67Q substitution near the catalytic zinc was shown previously to increase the Michaelis constant for acetaldehyde and to decrease turnover for ethanol oxidation. The W54R substitution, in the substrate binding site, increases kinetic constants (Ks, by >10-fold) while decreasing turnover numbers by 2-7-fold. Growth of yeast expressing the different ADHs on YPD plates (yeast extract, peptone and dextrose) plus antimycin to require fermentation, was positively correlated with the log of catalytic efficiency for the sequential bi reaction (V1/KiaKb=KeqV2/KpKiq, varying over 4 orders of magnitude, adjusted for different levels of ADH expression) in the order: WT≈H15R>H44R>W82R>E67Q>W54R. Growth on YPD plus 10mM allyl alcohol was inversely correlated with catalytic efficiency. The fitter yeast are "bradytrophs" (slow growing) because the ADHs have decreased catalytic efficiency.
15133083	Polyamine metabolism in a member of the phylum Microspora (Encephalitozoon cuniculi): effects of polyamine analogues.	The uptake, biosynthesis and catabolism of polyamines in the microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi are detailed with reference to the effects of oligoamine and arylamine analogues of polyamines. Enc. cuniculi, an intracellular parasite of mammalian cells, has both biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes of polyamine metabolism, as demonstrated in cell-free extracts of mature spores. The uptake of polyamines was measured in immature, pre-emergent spores isolated from host cells by Percoll gradient. Spermine was rapidly taken up and metabolized to spermidine and an unknown, possibly acetamidopropanal, by spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and polyamine oxidase (PAO). Most of the spermidine and the unknown product were found in the cell incubation medium, indicating they were released from the cell. bis(Ethyl) oligoamine analogues of polyamines, such as SL-11144 and SL-11158, as well as arylamine analogues [BW-1, a bis(phenylbenzyl) 3-7-3 analogue] blocked uptake and interconversion of spermine at micromolar levels and, in the case of BW-1, acted as substrate for PAO. The Enc. cuniculi PAO activity differed from that found in mammalian cells with respect to pH optimum, substrate specificity and sensitivity to known PAO inhibitors. SL-11158 inhibited SSAT activity with a mixed type of inhibition in which the analogue had a 70-fold higher affinity for the enzyme than the natural substrate, spermine. The interest in Enc. cuniculi polyamine metabolism and the biochemical effects of these polyamine analogues is warranted since they cure model infections of Enc. cuniculi in mice and are potential candidates for human clinical trials.
23146695	Puerarin mediates hepatoprotection against CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis rats through attenuation of inflammation response and amelioration of metabolic function.	This study was designed to evaluate the potential effects of puerarin (PR), an effective isoflavonoid compound purified from Pueraria lobata, in treating hepatic fibrosis (HF) rats induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4), 2 mL kg(-1) d(-1)). Compared to model control, PR treatment effectively lowered the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (Alb), total protein (TP) in HF rats. Masson stained analysis showed that the condition of HF rats was mitigated. Meanwhile, the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) expressions were significantly down-regulated at protein level by PR intervention. Additionally, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was elevated, while the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was lessened in liver tissue. As revealed by immunohistochemistry assay, PR therapy resulted in reduced production of transforming growth factor-βl (TGF-βl). Moreover, it also was attributed to decreased mRNA level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) using RT-PCR analysis. These findings demonstrate that puerarin successfully reverses hepatotoxicity in CCl(4)-induced HF rats via the underlying mechanisms of regulating serum enzymes and attenuating TNF-α/NF-κB pathway for anti-inflammation response, as well as improving metabolic function in liver tissue.
17403374	Regulation of gluconeogenesis by Kruppel-like factor 15.	In the postabsorptive state, certain tissues, including the brain, require glucose as the sole source of energy. After an overnight fast, hepatic glycogen stores are depleted, and gluconeogenesis becomes essential for preventing life-threatening hypoglycemia. Mice with a targeted deletion of KLF15, a member of the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors, display severe hypoglycemia after an overnight (18 hr) fast. We provide evidence that defective amino acid catabolism promotes the development of fasting hypoglycemia in KLF15-/- mice by limiting gluconeogenic substrate availability. KLF15-/- liver and skeletal muscle show markedly reduced mRNA expression of amino acid-degrading enzymes. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which converts the critical gluconeogenic amino acid alanine into pyruvate, is decreased (approximately 50%) in KLF15-/- hepatocytes. Consistent with this observation, intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate, but not alanine, rescues fasting hypoglycemia in KLF15-/- mice. We conclude that KLF15 plays an important role in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.
23534412	Antithrombotic activity of a newly synthesized coumarin derivative 3-(5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chroman-6-yl)-N-{2-[3-(5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chroman-6-yl)-propionylamino]-ethyl}-propionamide.	Anti-platelet therapy is a useful strategy to prevent acute thromboembolic artery occlusions. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of seselin derivatives against murine pulmonary thromboembolism, bleeding time, platelet activation and thrombosis. Administration of C3 (16 mg/kg) offered 70% protection against collagen- and epinephrine-induced pulmonary thromboembolism and 30% protection against arachidonic acid-induced death in mice, without adversely affecting bleeding time. No significant difference was observed by C3 in ferric chloride-induced arterial thrombosis in rats. Significant reduction in thrombus weight was observed in arteriovenous shunt model. In rat PRP, C3 reduced ADP and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In chronic hamster model of dyslipidemia, administration of C3 (16 mg/kg p.o. for 90 days) had no effect on plasma lipids, vasoreactivity and platelet adhesion. C3 fed hamsters showed reduced whole-blood aggregation response to ADP and collagen compared to HC-fed hamsters. In addition, C3 augmented thrombin time; however, time to occlusion was not increased. These results convincingly demonstrated that C3 is a novel molecule that reduces the risk of thrombosis and alleviates prothrombotic state associated with hyperlipidemia without any adverse effect on bleeding time. The high benefit/risk ratio of this compound makes it a suitable candidate for future valid studies.
8622118	Structure and pharmacological properties of a molluscan glutamate-gated cation channel and its likely role in feeding behavior.	We describe the isolation of a molluscan (Lymnaea stagnalis) full-length complementary DNA that encodes a mature polypeptide (which we have named Lym-eGluR2) with a predicted molecular weight of 105 kDa that exhibits 44-48% identity to the mammalian kainate-selective glutamate receptor GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 subunits. Injection of in vitro-transcribed RNA from this clone into Xenopus laevis oocytes results in the robust expression of homo-oligomeric cation channels that can be gated by L-glutamate (EC50 = 1.2 +/- 0.3 micron) and several other glutamate receptor agonists; rank order of potency: glutamate >> kainate > ibotenate > AMPA. These currents can be blocked by the mammalian non-NMDA receptor antagonists 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, and 1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid. Ionic-replacement experiments have shown that the agonist-induced current is carried entirely by sodium and potassium ions. In situ hybridization has revealed that the Lym-eGluR2 transcript is present in all 11 ganglia of the Lymnaea CNS, including the 4-cluster motorneurons within the paired buccal ganglia. The pharmacological properties and deduced location of Lym-eGluR2 are entirely consistent with it being (a component of) the receptor, which has been identified previously on buccal motorneurons, that mediates the excitatory effects of glutamate released from neurons within the feeding central pattern generator.
23541434	Pharmacological study of a new Asp49 phospholipase A2 (Bbil-TX) isolated from Bothriopsis bilineata smargadina (forest viper) venom in vertebrate neuromuscular preparations.	The neuromuscular activity of Bbil-TX, a PLA2 with catalytic activity isolated from Bothriopsis bilineata smargadina venom, was examined in chick biventer cervicis (BC) and mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm (PND) preparations. In BC preparations, Bbil-TX (0.5-10 μg/ml) caused time- and concentration-dependent blockade that was not reversed by washing; the times for 50% blockade were 87 ± 7, 41 ± 7 and 19 ± 2 min (mean ± SEM; n = 4-6) for 1, 5 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Muscle contractures to exogenous ACh and KCl were unaffected. The toxin (10 μg/ml) also did not affect the twitch-tension of directly-stimulated, curarized (10 μg/ml) BC preparations. However, Bbil-TX (10 μg/ml) produced mild morphological alterations (edematous and/or hyperchromic fibers) in BC; there was also a progressive release of CK (from 116 ± 17 IU/ml (basal) to 710 ± 91 IU/ml after 45 min). Bbil-TX (5 μg/ml)-induced blockade was markedly inhibited at 22-24 °C and pretreatment with p-bromophenacyl bromide (p-BPB) abolished the neuromuscular blockade. Bbil-TX (3-30 μg/ml, n = 4-6) caused partial time- and concentration-dependent blockade in PND preparations (52 ± 2% at the highest concentration). Bbil-TX (30 μg/ml) also markedly reduced the MEPPs frequency [from 26 ± 2.5 (basal) to 10 ± 1 after 60 min; n = 5; p < 0.05] and the quantal content [from 94 ± 14 (basal) to 24 ± 3 after 60 min; n = 5; p < 0.05] of PND preparations, but caused only minor depolarization of the membrane resting potential [from -80 ± 1 mV (basal) to -66 ± 2 mV after 120 min; n = 5; p < 0.05], with no significant change in the depolarizing response to exogenous carbachol. These results show that Bbil-TX is a presynaptic PLA2 that contributes to the neuromuscular blockade caused by B. b. smargadina venom.
15306222	Carvedilol selectively inhibits oscillatory intracellular calcium changes evoked by human alpha1D- and alpha1B-adrenergic receptors.	BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that carvedilol, an antagonist of alpha1- and beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs), provides an effective treatment for chronic heart failure, whereas nonselective alpha1-AR blockade has an adverse outcome in this disease. It is, however, not clear whether carvedilol exhibits a subtype-dependent impact on three distinct alpha1-adrenergic receptors (alpha1-ARs). METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined binding properties of human ARs for carvedilol using HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells expressing a single AR subtype. Our results showed that the affinities of alpha1D-AR and alpha1B-AR for carvedilol are higher than that of the beta1-AR subtype, a major target in heart failure treatment. The affinity rank order and pKi values of ARs for carvedilol were as follows: alpha1D-AR (8.9)>alpha1B-AR (8.6)>beta1-AR (8.4)>beta2-AR (8.0)>alpha1A-AR (7.9)?alpha2C-AR (5.9)>alpha2B-AR (5.5)>alpha2A-AR (5.3). Furthermore, temporal kinetics of intracellular calcium signaling mediated via alpha1D- and alpha1B-ARs, but not via alpha1A-AR (P<0.01), showed oscillatory patterns with frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 3 per minute in human smooth muscle and HEK293 cells, which were inhibited by the therapeutic concentrations of carvedilol (10 nM) in a subtype-dependent manner. When oscillatory alpha1B-AR and non-oscillatory alpha1A-AR were co-expressed and heteromer receptors were detected with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation, carvedilol suppressed only oscillatory component of global cytosolic free calcium change. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in addition to beta-ARs, receptor inhibition by carvedilol is directed to alpha1-ARs, preferably to alpha1D- and alpha1B-AR-mediated signaling events, including intracellular calcium oscillations in vascular smooth muscle.
10480573	Effect of thiazinotrienomycin B, an ansamycin antibiotic, on the function of epidermal growth factor receptor in human stomach tumor cells.	Thiazinotrienomycin B (TT-B), an ansamycin isolated from fermentation broths of Streptomyces sp. MJ672-m3, inhibited the growth in vitro of human stomach tumor SC-6 cells over 10 times more strongly than the growth of other human tumor cells, such as HeLa (cervix), T24 (bladder) and LX-1 (lung). The extent of growth inhibition by TT-B of SC-6, but not of LX-1 nor T24, was lowered in a competitive manner by raising serum concentrations in the culture medium. TT-B inhibited the cell cycle progression of SC-6 at an early stage of the progression from G0/G1 to S. The inhibition was again competitive with serum concentrations in the culture medium. No direct inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed at the concentration range which caused the cell cycle arrest. TT-B and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) were antagonistic to each other in inhibiting the cell cycle progression of SC-6 from G0/G1 to S, suggesting that the two compounds share the same target, EGFR. The kinase activity of EGFR was little inhibited by TT-B in a cell-free system.
15985434	Crystal structure of pyridoxal kinase in complex with roscovitine and derivatives.	Pyridoxal kinase (PDXK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine in the presence of ATP and Zn2+. This constitutes an essential step in the synthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6, a cofactor for over 140 enzymes. (R)-Roscovitine (CYC202, Seliciclib) is a relatively selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), currently evaluated for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, renal diseases, and several viral infections. Affinity chromatography investigations have shown that (R)-roscovitine also interacts with PDXK. To understand this interaction, we determined the crystal structure of PDXK in complex with (R)-roscovitine, N6-methyl-(R)-roscovitine, and O6-(R)-roscovitine, the two latter derivatives being designed to bind to PDXK but not to CDKs. Structural analysis revealed that these three roscovitines bind similarly in the pyridoxal-binding site of PDXK rather than in the anticipated ATP-binding site. The pyridoxal pocket has thus an unexpected ability to accommodate molecules different from and larger than pyridoxal. This work provides detailed structural information on the interactions between PDXK and roscovitine and analogs. It could also aid in the design of roscovitine derivatives displaying strict selectivity for either PDXK or CDKs.
11489456	Evidence that hypophagia induced by d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine in the rat is mediated by 5-HT2C receptors.	The present series of studies is the first to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms underlying d-fenfluramine- and d-norfenfluramine-induced hypophagia in the rat using highly selective serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonists. Administration of d-fenfluramine, and its major metabolite d-norfenfluramine, suppresses food intake in animals. Both compounds stimulate the release of serotonin and are potent inhibitors of the re-uptake of 5-HT into nerve terminals. In addition, d-norfenfluramine also acts as a direct 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor agonist. Pre-treatment with the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, SB-242084 (0.3-3 mg/kg), dose-dependently inhibited both d-fenfluramine- (3 mg/kg) and d-norfenfluramine-induced (2 mg/kg) hypophagia. In contrast, the hypophagic effect of d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine was unaffected by prior treatment with the highly selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonists, SB-215505 (0.3-3 mg/kg) and RS-127445 (1-3 mg/kg) or the 5-HT2A receptor antagonists MDL 100,907 (0.003-0.03 mg/kg) and ketanserin (0.2, 0.5 mg/kg). In addition, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (0.3, 1 mg/kg) and the 5-HT1B receptor antagonists GR-127935 (1, 2 mg/kg) and SB-224289 (2-10 mg/kg) did not affect d-fenfluramine-induced hypophagia. These data provide unequivocal evidence for an important role of the 5-HT2C receptor in the mediation of d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine-induced hypophagia in the rat and do not support the involvement of 5-HT1A/1B/2A/2B receptors.
16823043	Structure of the angiogenesis inhibitor ovalicin bound to its noncognate target, human Type 1 methionine aminopeptidase.	Methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) remove the initiator methionine during protein biosynthesis. They exist in two isoforms, MetAP1 and MetAP2. The anti-angiogenic compound fumagillin binds tightly to the Type 2 MetAPs but only weakly to Type 1. High-affinity complexes of fumagillin and its relative ovalicin with Type 2 human MetAP have been reported. Here we describe the crystallographic structure of the low-affinity complex between ovalicin and Type 1 human MetAP at 1.1 A resolution. This provides the first opportunity to compare the structures of ovalicin or fumagillin bound to a Type 1 and a Type 2 MetAP. For both Type 1 and Type 2 human MetAPs the inhibitor makes a covalent adduct with a corresponding histidine. At the same time there are significant differences in the alignment of the inhibitors within the respective active sites. It has been argued that the lower affinity of ovalicin and fumagillin for the Type 1 MetAPs is due to the smaller size of their active sites relative to the Type 2 enzymes. Comparison with the uncomplexed structure of human Type 1 MetAP indicates that there is some truth to this. Several active site residues have to move "outward" by 0.5 Angstroms or so to accommodate the inhibitor. Other residues move "inward." There are, however, other factors that come into play. In particular, the side chain of His310 rotates by 134 degrees into a different position where (together with Glu128 and Tyr195) it coordinates a metal ion not seen at this site in the native enzyme.
23395667	Growth factor delivery from hydrogel particle aggregates to promote tubular regeneration after acute kidney injury.	Local delivery of growth factors (GFs) can accelerate regeneration of injured tissue, but for many medical applications, injectable GF delivery systems are required for clinical success. Viscoelastic, injectable aggregates of micrometer-sized hydrogel particles made of multiarmed polyethylene glycol (starPEG) and heparin were prepared and tested for site-specific paracrine stimulation of tissue regeneration. Heparin was used as it binds, protects and releases numerous GFs. Hydrogel based delivery of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and murine epidermal growth factor (EGF) was monitored utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). bFGF was released slowly because of its high affinity to the heparin while the significantly higher release of the non-specific binding EGF was controlled by diffusion only. To investigate GF delivery in vivo, a hydrogel loaded with murine EGF or bFGF was injected subcapsularly into the left kidney of mice with experimental acute kidney injury caused by glycerol induced rhabdomyolysis. Visual examination confirmed sustained stability of the injected gel aggregates during the timescale of the experiment. The number of proliferating kidney tubular epithelial cells was quantified both in the injected kidney and the non-injected contralateral kidney. bFGF delivery from hydrogels induced a significant increase in cell proliferation in the injected kidney, although small effects were also seen in the non-injected kidney due to a systemic effect. EGF delivery strongly increased cell proliferation for both kidneys, but also showed a local effect on the injected kidney. The hydrogel without loaded GFs was used as a control and showed no increase in cell proliferation. Our results suggest that this novel starPEG-heparin hydrogel system can be an effective approach to deliver GFs locally.
23500387	Curcumin attenuates allergic airway inflammation by regulation of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs)/Th17 balance in ovalbumin-sensitized mice.	The present study aimed to determine the protective effects and the underlying mechanisms of curcumin on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic inflammation in a mouse model of allergic asthma. Asthma mice model was established by ovalbumin. A total of 60 mice were randomly assigned to six experimental groups: control, model, dexamethasone (2mg/kg), and curcumin (50mg/kg, 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg). Airway resistance (Raw) was measured by the forced oscillation technique, differential cell count in BAL fluid (BALF) was measured by Wright-Giemsa staining, histological assessment was measured by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, BALF levels of Treg/Th17 cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Treg cells and Th17 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM). Our study demonstrated that curcumin inhibited OVA-induced increases in eosinophil count; interleukin (IL)-17A level were recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increased IL-10 level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological studies demonstrated that curcumin substantially inhibited OVA-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue. Flow cytometry (FCM) studies demonstrated that curcumin remarkably inhibited Th17 cells and significantly increased Treg cells. The results in vivo show ovalbumin-induced significantly broke Treg/Th17 balance; curcumin treatments markedly attenuated the inflammatory in asthma model by regulating Treg/Th17 balance. Our findings support the possible use of curcumin as a therapeutic drug for patients with allergic asthma.
12529935	Structure-function of the glucagon receptor family of G protein-coupled receptors: the glucagon, GIP, GLP-1, and GLP-2 receptors.	The glucagon-like peptides include glucagon, GLP-1, and GLP-2, and exert diverse actions on nutrient intake, gastrointestinal motility, islet hormone secretion, cell proliferation and apoptosis, nutrient absorption, and nutrient assimilation. GIP, a related member of the glucagon peptide superfamily, also regulates nutrient disposal via stimulation of insulin secretion. The actions of these peptides are mediated by distinct members of the glucagon receptor superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. These receptors exhibit unique patterns of tissue-specific expression, exhibit considerable amino acid sequence identity, and share similar structural and functional properties with respect to ligand binding and signal transduction. This article provides an overview of the biology of these receptors with an emphasis on understanding the unique actions of glucagon-related peptides through studies of the biology of their cognate receptors.
11522647	Activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases: association with epidermal growth factor receptor/transforming growth factor alpha expression in head and neck squamous carcinoma and inhibition by anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatments.	The expression of the activated mitogen-activated kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) ERK1 and ERK2 was characterized in 101 humanhead and neck squamous carcinoma specimens. Activated ERK1/2were detected at different levels in the majority of these tumors, as assayed by immunostaining with an antibody specific for the dually phosphorylated and activated ERK1 and ERK2. ERK1/2 activation levels were higher in tumors with advanced regional lymph node metastasis (P = 0.048) and in relapsed tumors (P = 0.021). The expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (P = 0.037), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha; P < 0.001), and HER2 (P = 0.066; positive trend) correlated with activation of ERK1/2. In a multivariate analysis, both TGF-alpha (P < 0.0001) and HER2 (P = 0.045) were independently correlated with ERK1/2 activation. In turn, activation of ERK1/2 was associated with a higher Ki-67 proliferative index (P = 0.002). In EGF receptor-dependent model cells (A431 and DiFi), a specific EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ("Iressa"; ZD1839) and a chimeric anti-EGF receptor antibody ("Cetuximab"; C225) inhibited ERK 1/2 activation at concentrations that inhibited autocrine cell proliferation. In patients on treatment with C225, the activation of ERK1/2 in skin, an EGF receptor-dependent tissue, was lower compared with control skin. Parallel changes were seen in keratinocyte Ki67 proliferation indexes in skin from C225-treated patients. Taken together, these studies provide support for a role of activation of ERK1/2 in head and neck squamous carcinoma and a correlation with EGF receptor/TGF-alpha expression. The inhibition of ERK1/2 activation in vitro and in vivo by compounds targeting the EGF receptor points to the interest of ERK1/2 as potential surrogate markers of EGF-receptor signaling in clinical therapeutic studies.
2889803	Benzodiazepine receptor binding of triazolobenzodiazepines in vivo: increased receptor number with low-dose alprazolam.	Triazolobenzodiazepines are in clinical use as hypnotics and anxiolytics. We analyzed in vivo receptor binding and brain concentrations of alprazolam, triazolam, and estazolam. Drug concentrations measured in the cerebral cortex 1 h after administration were directly proportional to dose for all three compounds. In vivo receptor binding, as defined by the specific uptake of [3H]Ro15-1788, decreased with increasing doses of estazolam and triazolam, a finding indicating dose-related increases in receptor occupancy due to these compounds. Triazolam was substantially more potent, with an IC50 value of 16 ng/g, compared with 117 ng/g for estazolam. At higher doses of alprazolam (greater than 0.2 mg/kg), receptor binding by [3H]Ro15-1788, likewise decreased with increasing dose of the former drug. However, at lower doses of alprazolam (0.02-0.05 mg/kg), which resulted in cortex concentrations of 2-7 ng/g, receptor binding was increased above control values in cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus but not in several other brain regions. Binding returned to control values at doses of greater than or equal to 0.01 mg/kg. Similar results were obtained in time course studies. At 8 and 10 h after a dose of 1 mg/kg i.p., corresponding to cortex concentrations of 2.7-7 ng/g, receptor binding was increased compared with controls. Similarly, at 1, 2, and 3 h after a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg, corresponding to cortex concentrations of 3.7-5.8 ng/g, receptor binding was also increased. The apparent affinity of benzodiazepine receptors for clonazepam in mice receiving alprazolam (0.05 mg/kg) was unchanged from that in untreated control mice, an observation suggesting that low doses of alprazolam increased receptor number.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
1327384	[3H]-RS-15385-197, a selective and high affinity radioligand for alpha 2-adrenoceptors: implications for receptor classification.	1. RS-15385-197 is the most potent and selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist available. We have used [3H]-RS-15385-197 to define alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtypes. The binding of [3H]-RS-15385-197 to membranes of rat cerebral cortex, rat neonatal lung and human platelets was reversible, saturable and of high affinity. Saturation experiments indicated that [3H]-RS-15385-197 bound to a single population of sites in all 3 tissues with high affinity (0.08-0.14 nM). The density of sites labelled by [3H]-RS-15385-197 was greater in the cortex (275 fmol mg-1 protein) than in the neonate lung (174 fmol mg-1 protein) and human platelet (170 fmol mg-1 protein). The density of sites labelled with [3H]-RS-15385-197 in the cortex was significantly greater than that labelled with [3H]-yohimbine (121 fmol mg-1 protein). 2. The selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, idazoxan, yohimbine, rauwolscine and WY 26703 displaced [3H]-RS-15385-197 binding to rat cerebral cortex in a simple manner with Hill slopes close to unity. The affinities derived for these antagonists against [3H]-RS-15385-197 were similar to the values obtained for the displacement of [3H]-yohimbine indicating the alpha 2-adrenoceptor nature of the binding site. 3. alpha 2A-Adrenoceptor selective compounds, oxymetazoline and BRL 44409, showed high affinity for [3H]-RS-15385-197 binding in the human platelet and lower affinity in the neonate lung, while the alpha 2B-selective compounds, prazosin and imiloxan, showed high affinity for [3H]-RS-15385-197 binding in the neonate lung.This suggests that [3H]-RS-15385-197 labels both alpha2A- and alpha2B-adrenoceptor subtypes.4. Prazosin and methysergide inhibited the binding of [3H]-RS-15385-197 in the rat cerebral cortex in a simple manner consistent with an interaction at a single site. Although oxymetazoline inhibited [H]-RS- 15385-197 with a Hill slope significantly different from unity, the slope was increased to unity in the presence of Gpp(NH)p, suggesting an agonist-like interaction.5. The site labelled by [3H]-RS-15385-197 in the rat cortex shows high affinity for oxymetazoline and low affinity for prazosin which could be taken as evidence for classifying the site as an alpha2A-subtype.However, the affinities of yohimbine, rauwolscine and oxymetazoline at this site do not correspond to the population of sites in the human platelet. Yohimbine and rauwolscine were 20 fold selective for the platelet alph2A-subtype, whereas phentolamine was 2 fold and imiloxan was 10 fold selective for the cortex subtype. Indeed although the site showed some similarities with the alpha2A-subtype, the highest degree of homology was observed between this site and the rat submaxillary gland and the RG20 clone,tentatively called the alpha2D-adrenoceptor subtype. We propose that the alpha2-adrenoceptor in the rat cortex may therefore correspond to the putative alpha2D-subtype of the adrenoceptor.
23206862	Identification of a novel benzimidazole derivative as a highly potent NPY Y5 receptor antagonist with an anti-obesity profile.	Optimization of HTS hit 1 for NPY Y5 receptor binding affinity, CYP450 inhibition, solubility and metabolic stability led to the identification of some orally available oxygen-linker derivatives for in vivo study. Among them, derivative 4i inhibited food intake induced by the NPY Y5 selective agonist, and chronic oral administration of 4i in DIO mice caused a dose-dependent reduction of body weight gain.
23123425	Dietary quercetin ameliorates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis induced by a high-fat diet in gerbils.	Dietary quercetin is highly abundant in edible plants, which possesses a wide range of pharmacological properties. This study was to investigate hepatoprotective effects of quercetin in the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) gerbils induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), and to evaluate its regulatory mechanism on hepatic inflammatory response. The gerbils were fed with HFD for 28 days to induce NASH. From 15th day to 28th day, the treated drugs were given daily to each animal, respectively. The lipid profiles and biochemical markers were determined at the end of the experiment. The expressions of Sirt1, NF-κB p65 and iNOS were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. The results showed that oral administration of quercetin at doses of 30-60 mg/kg to hyperlipidemia rats for 14 days were highly effective in decreasing the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). It could decrease lipid accumulation in the hepatocytes, and reduce serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 via regulating the expressions of Sirt1, NF-κB p65 and iNOS. Thus, dietary quercetin had significant therapeutic benefits and could be explored as a potential promising candidate for the prevention of NASH.
17133434	Hormones and body size evolution in papionin primates.	This study examines the evolution of size differences among papionin primates by measuring hormones that regulate size growth during ontogeny and influence ultimate adult size (insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), growth hormone binding protein (GHBP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone, estradiol). The analyses assess longstanding ideas about circulating hormone levels and body size. Importantly, because the consensus papionin molecular phylogeny implies at least two episodes of size increase, this study offers opportunities to determine whether or not similar hormone profiles regulate this apparent evolutionary convergence (i.e., do larger-bodied papionins have higher levels of growth-related hormones than smaller-bodied papionins?). Five hundred and sixty serum samples (from 161 individuals) from 11 papionin species were analyzed using a two-level approach to address this issue. One used mixed longitudinal samples from two papionin species to test whether, during growth, large- and small-bodied species have higher and lower hormone levels, respectively. The second compared multiple papionin species to assess whether or not hormone levels covary with size in adult animals. Result show that size and hormone levels do not covary consistently across papionins, either during growth or in adulthood. Specifically, some smaller-bodied papionin species have higher absolute hormone levels than larger-bodied species. Differences in some hormone levels appear to track phylogeny more closely than body size. In contrast to studies based on single species, we demonstrate that, while the hormones analyzed affect growth, absolute circulating hormone levels either during growth or adulthood may be decoupled from interspecific differences in body size.
11120594	Cytokine production by naive and primary effector CD4+ T cells exposed to norepinephrine.	We recently showed that clones of Th1 cells, but not Th2 cells, expressed a functional beta-2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) and that either norepinephrine or the beta2AR agonist terbutaline stimulated this receptor to modulate the level of Th1 cytokines produced. In the present study, we show that norepinephrine and terbutaline stimulate the beta2AR to decrease the level of IL-2 produced by freshly isolated murine splenic naive CD4+ T cells from either Balb/C or DO11.10 transgenic mice and activated polyclonally with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs. In contrast, the level of cytokines produced by primary effector Th1 and Th2 cells were unaffected when norepinephrine, terbutaline, or cAMP analogs were added at the time of restimulation. These results suggest that a diversity exists among CD4+ T-cell subsets with respect to the level of adrenergic receptor expression, responsiveness to cAMP, stage of cell differentiation, or a combination of the above.
23333640	The inhibition of HIF-2α on the ATM/Chk-2 pathway is involved in the promotion effect of arsenite on benzo(a)pyrene-induced cell transformation.	Both arsenite and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) are known human carcinogens. Studies on the mode-of-action of arsenite indicate that it can also act as co-carcinogen or as a cancer promoter, and that it can facilitate progression of cancers. Some studies on development of lung cancers have suggested a synergism between arsenite exposure and cigarette smoking. The mechanism of action for such an effect, however, remains obscure. In the present study, we investigated the effects of HIF-2α on arsenite- and BaP-induced cell malignant transformation as well as on signal transduction pathways in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. The results show that arsenite accelerates the neoplastic transformation and migration of cells and enhances chromosomal aberrations induced by BaP. HIF-2α is involved in blocking the effects of arsenite in activating the ATM/Chk-2 pathway and in repair of DNA damage induced by BaP. Moreover, blocking of HIF-2α prevents the effects of arsenite on the neoplastic transformation, cell migration, and chromosomal aberrations caused by BaP. These results indicate that the repressive effect of HIF-2α on the ATM/Chk-2 pathway leads to genomic instability, which is involved in arsenite-accelerated, BaP-induced malignant transformation of HBE cells.
23523101	Activation of PPARγ is required for hydroxysafflor yellow A of Carthamus tinctorius to attenuate hepatic fibrosis induced by oxidative stress.	Oxidative stress caused hepatic fibrosis by activating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which were implemented by depressing PPARγ activation. Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) as a nature active ingredient with antioxidant capacity was able to effectively attenuate oxidative stress mediated injury. So it will be very interesting to study effect of HSYA on HSCs activation and liver fibrosis, and reveal the role of PPARγ·CCl4 and H2O2 were used to mimic oxidative stress mediated hepatic injury in vitro and in vivo respectively. The anti-fibrosis effects of HSYA were evaluated and its mechanisms were disclosed by applying western blot, histopathological analysis, flow cytometry, RT-PCR and ELISA. Our results showed that HSCs activation and proliferation could be induced by oxidative stress, and the expressive levels of TGF-β1 and TIMP-1, the serum levels of ALT, AST, HA, LN, III-C and IV-C were also enhanced by oxidative stress, which is correlated with liver fibrosis (p<0.05 or p<0.01). HSYA was able to effectively inhibit oxidative stress mediated hepatic injury by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, up regulating the expression of PPARγ and MMP-2, and down regulating the expression of TGF-β1 and TIMP-1, and reducing α-SMA level. The protective effect of HSYA can be significantly attenuated by GW9662 via blocking PPARγ (p<0.05 or p<0.01). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HSYA is able to significantly protect the liver from oxidative stress, which requires for HSYA to stimulate PPARγ activity, reduce cell proliferation and suppress ECM synthesis.
12200198	Neuroprotection by propargylamines in Parkinson's disease: suppression of apoptosis and induction of prosurvival genes.	In Parkinson's disease (PD), therapies to delay or suppress the progression of cell death in nigrostriatal dopamine neurons have been proposed by use of various agents. An inhibitor of type B monoamine oxidase (MAO-B), (-)deprenyl (selegiline), was reported to have neuroprotective activity, but clinical trials failed to confirm it. However, the animal and cellular models of PD proved that selegiline protects neurons from cell death. Among selegiline-related propargylamines, (R)(+)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan (rasagiline) was the most effective to suppress the cell death in in vivo and in vitro experiments. In this paper, the mechanism of the neuroprotection by rasagiline was examined using human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells against cell death induced by an endogenous dopaminergic neurotoxin N-methyl(R)salsolinol (NM(R)Sal). NM(R)Sal induced apoptosis (but not necrosis) in SH-SY5Y cells, and the apoptotic cascade was initiated by mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) and activated by stepwise reactions. Rasagiline prevented the PT in mitochondria directly and also indirectly through induction of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and a neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Long-term administration of propargylamines to rats increased the activities of antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase in the brain regions containing dopamine neurons. Rasagiline and related propargylamines may rescue degenerating dopamine neurons through inhibiting death signal transduction initiated by mitochondria PT.
12970106	Agonist actions of dihydroergotamine at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors and their possible relevance to antimigraine efficacy.	1. The pharmaceutical compound, dihydroergotamine (DHE) is dispensed to prevent and reduce the occurrence of migraine attacks. Although still controversial, the prophylactic effect of this drug is believed to be caused through blockade and/or activation of numerous receptors including serotonin (5-HT) receptors of the 5-HT2 subtype. 2. To elucidate if 5-HT2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) may be involved in DHE prophylactic effect, we performed investigations aimed to determine the respective pharmacological profile of DHE and of its major metabolite 8'-hydroxy-DHE (8'-OH-DHE) at the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2CRs by binding, inositol triphosphate (IP3) or cyclic GMP (cGMP) coupling studies in transfected fibroblasts. 3. DHE and 8'-OH-DHE are competitive compounds at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2CRs. 8'-OH-DHE interaction at (5-HT2BRs) was best fitted by a biphasic competition curve and displayed the highest affinity with a Ki of 5 nm. These two compounds acted as agonists for both receptors in respect to cGMP production with pEC50 of 8.32+/-0.09 for 8'-OH-DHE at 5-HT2B and 7.83+/-0.06 at 5-HT2CRs. 4. Knowing that the antimigraine prophylactic effect of DHE is only observed after long-term treatment, we chronically exposed the recombinant cells to DHE and 8'-OH-DHE. The number of 5-HT2BR-binding sites was always more affected than 5-HT2CRs. At 5-HT2BRs, 8'-OH-DHE was more effective than DHE, with an uncoupling that persisted for more than 40 h for IP3 or cGMP. By contrast, the 5-HT2CR coupling was reversible after either treatment. 5. Chronic exposure to 8'-OH-DHE caused a persistent agonist-mediated desensitisation of 5-HT2B, but not 5-HT2CRs. This may be of relevance to therapeutic actions of the compound.
19620795	[Mammalian target of rapamycin, its mode of action and clinical response in metastatic clear cell carcinoma].	The mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR)and its molecular pathways are supposed to be activated frequently in human renal cell carcinoma as well as other cancers. It has a kinase activity for 40S ribosomal protein kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1. These proteins, when phosphorylated, promote protein translation and RNA transcription in the nutrient-rich condition. mTOR inhibitors such as Temsirolimus (CCI779) and Everolimus (RAD001) are effective for suppressing cell growth with inhibiting mTOR kinase activity. Rapamycin and its related analogs such as Temsirolimus and Everolimus are less toxic for humans compared with other anti-VEGFR inhibitors and has been used as an immunosuppressive agent. These agents have an inhibitory activity against the mTORC1 complex. Since they do not have inhibitory activity against mTORC2 complex, the ability of mTOR inhibition by Temsirolimus is supposed to be 40 to 50% of full inhibition in mTOR kinase. Temsirolimus has modest anticancer activity against advanced clinical RCC patients with poor risk. The objective response rate was only 7%, 26% of patients experienced minor responses and another 17% of patients had stable disease that lasted 6 months. The median time to tumor progression and median survival for the study patients were 5.8 and 15.0 months, respectively. The overall survival of patients treated with Temsirolimus alone was statistically longer than in those treated with IFN alone in the 626 cases in phase II study. Combinations of mTOR with other anti- VEGFR agents were not effective. Vertical therapies of mTOR inhibitor in combination with AKT inhibitors, or newly development of stronger mTOR kinase which can suppress both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are planned at present.
23474014	Time-dependent effects of corticosterone on reward-based decision-making in a rodent model of the Iowa Gambling Task.	Corticosteroid hormones, released after stress, are known to change neuronal activity in two time-domains: within minutes via non-genomic pathways and with a delay of >1 h through pathways involving transcriptional regulation. Recent evidence in rodents and humans indicates that these two modes of corticosteroid action differently affect cognitive tasks. Here, we investigated whether reward-based decision-making, in a rat model of the Iowa Gambling Task (rIGT), is also differently altered by rapid versus delayed actions of corticosterone. We targeted the rapid and delayed time domain by injecting corticosterone (CORT, 1 mg/kg, s.c.) at 30 min (rapid) or 180 min (delayed) respectively prior to behavioural testing, during the final 3 days of the behavioural paradigm. In saline treated rats, the number of visits to the disadvantageous arm decreased over trial blocks, whilst this was attenuated when CORT was administered 30 min before testing. This attenuation was associated with a significantly increased c-Fos expression in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and insular cortex, and a trend for an increase in the infralimbic cortex. The rapid corticosteroid effect contrasted with treatment 180 min before testing, where the number of visits to the disadvantageous arm as well as c-Fos labelling was not affected. These findings indicate that rapid corticosteroid actions impair reward-based decision-making.
2450203	Benzodiazepines, but not beta carbolines, limit high frequency repetitive firing of action potentials of spinal cord neurons in cell culture.	Effects of benzodiazepines (BDZs) and beta carbolines (beta CCs) on sustained repetitive firing at high frequency (SRF) of action potentials of mouse spinal cord neurons in cell culture were examined using intracellular recording techniques. In control medium neurons responded to depolarizing current pulses with SRF. Limitation of SRF was produced by the anticonvulsant BDZs (diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam and lorazepam) at low to mid nanomolar concentrations, by a convulsant BDZ which does not bind to high affinity BDZ receptors (Ro 5-4864) at high nanomolar concentrations and by a BDZ receptor weak partial agonist (Ro 15-1788) at micromolar concentrations. The limitation of SRF was accompanied by use- and voltage-dependent reduction of maximal rate of rise (Vmax) of sodium-dependent action potentials. Partial agonist and inverse agonist beta CCs did not limit SRF at concentrations up to 200 nM. The limitation of SRF by diazepam was not prevented by inverse or partial agonists at the BDZ receptor, including Ro 15-1788 and the beta CCs. These findings suggest that limitation of SRF was produced by binding of BDZs, but not beta CCs, to voltage-dependent sodium channels and not to high affinity central BDZ receptors, and that BDZs limit SRF by slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation. We propose that the limitation of SRF may contribute to the efficacy of BDZs against generalized tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus.
23437843	Discovery, biological evaluation, and structure-activity and -selectivity relationships of 6'-substituted (E)-2-(benzofuran-3(2H)-ylidene)-N-methylacetamides, a novel class of potent and selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors.	The use of selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and B (MAO-B) holds a therapeutic relevance in the treatment of depressive disorders and Parkinson's disease (PD), respectively. Here, the discovery of a new class of compounds acting as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-Is) and bearing a 6'-substituted (E)-2-(benzofuran-3(2H)-ylidene)-N-alkylacetamide skeleton is reported. 6'-Sulfonyloxy derivatives exhibited outstanding affinities to MAO-A (7.0 nM < IC50 < 49 nM, much higher than moclobemide) and a pronounced MAO-A/B selectivity. The corresponding 6'-benzyloxy derivatives showed potent MAO-B inhibition and inverted selectivity profile. The rigid E-geometry of the exocyclic double bond allowed a more efficient binding conformation compared to more flexible and less active 2-(1-benzofuran-3-yl)-N-methylacetamide isomers and 4-N-methylcarboxamidomethylcoumarin analogues. Focused structural modifications and docking simulations enabled the identification of key molecular determinants for high affinity toward both MAO isoforms. These novel MAO-Is may represent promising hits for the development of safer therapeutic agents with a potential against depression, PD, and other age-related neurodegenerative pathologies.
23287710	Dose dependent molecular effects of acrylamide and glycidamide in human cancer cell lines and human primary hepatocytes.	Recently published studies suggest a weak positive correlation between increased dietary acrylamide intake and the increased risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer. However, risk assessment of acrylamide remains difficult because the carcinogenic mechanisms are still unknown and in particular the molecular effects of low level acrylamide exposure as seen by dietary intake are not well understood. Therefore, we analyzed in ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines as well as in primary hepatocytes the expression of genes involved in cancer development and xenobiotic metabolism after high and low dose exposure (1-0.001mM) of acrylamide and its metabolite glycidamide. In conclusion our in vitro results demonstrate that exposure to high doses of glycidamide/acrylamide - exceeding the dietary exposure of the general population by far - can induce genes with growth promoting potential like the oncogene cMYC and genes involved in the MAPK pathway. However, low-dose exposure seems to activate primarily genes involved in the elimination of the toxicant.
17471183	Tricyclic antidepressant pharmacology and therapeutic drug interactions updated.	New data on the pharmacology of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), their affinities for human cloned CNS receptors and their cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibition profiles, allow improved deductions concerning their effects and interactions and indicate which of the TCAs are the most useful. The relative toxicity of TCAs continues to be more precisely defined, as do TCA interactions with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). TCA interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have been, historically, an uncertain and difficult question, but are now well understood, although this is not reflected in the literature. The data indicate that nortriptyline and desipramine have the most pharmacologically desirable characteristics as noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), and as drugs with few interactions that are also safe when coadministered with either MAOIs or SSRIs. Clomipramine is the only available antidepressant drug that has good evidence of clinically relevant serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition (SNRI). These data assist drug selection for monotherapy and combination therapy and predict reliably how and why pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions occur. In comparison, two newer drugs proposed to have SNRI properties, duloxetine and venlafaxine, may have insufficient NRI potency to be effective SNRIs. Combinations such as sertraline and nortriptyline may therefore offer advantages over drugs like venlafaxine that have fixed ratios of SRI/NRI effects that are not ideal. However, no TCA/SSRI combination is sufficiently safe to be universally applicable without expert knowledge. Standard texts (e.g. the British National Formulary) and treatment guidelines would benefit by taking account of these new data and understandings.
22790794	Novel electrophysiological properties of dronedarone: inhibition of human cardiac two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels.	Dronedarone is currently used for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Pharmacological inhibition of cardiac two-pore-domain potassium (K(2P)) channels results in action potential prolongation and has recently been proposed as novel antiarrhythmic strategy. We hypothesized that blockade of human K(2P) channels contributes to the electrophysiological efficacy of dronedarone in AF. Two-electrode voltage clamp and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology was used to record K(2P) currents from Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells. All functional human K(2P) channels were screened for dronedarone sensitivity, revealing significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of cardiac K(2P)2.1 (TREK1; IC(50) = 26.7 muM) and K(2P)3.1 channels (TASK1; IC(50) = 18.7 muM) with maximum current reduction of 60.3 and 65.5 % in oocytes. IC(50) values obtained from mammalian cells yielded 6.1 muM (K(2P)2.1) and 5.2 muM (K(2P)3.1). The molecular mechanism of action was studied in detail. Dronedarone block affected open and closed channels. K(2P)3.1 currents were reduced in frequency-dependent fashion in contrast to K(2P)2.1. Mutagenesis studies revealed that amino acid residues implicated in K(2P)3.1 drug interactions were not required for dronedarone blockade. The class III antiarrhythmic drug dronedarone targets multiple human cardiac two-pore-domain potassium channels, including atrial-selective K(2P)3.1 currents. K(2P) current inhibition by dronedarone represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of action that extends the multichannel blocking profile of the drug.
23471540	Global analysis of Drosophila Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins reveals a multitude of novel recognition motifs and binding determinants.	Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) are the largest group of transcription factors in higher metazoans. A complete characterization of these ZFPs and their associated target sequences is pivotal to fully annotate transcriptional regulatory networks in metazoan genomes. As a first step in this process, we have characterized the DNA-binding specificities of 129 zinc finger sets from Drosophila using a bacterial one-hybrid system. This data set contains the DNA-binding specificities for at least one encoded ZFP from 70 unique genes and 23 alternate splice isoforms representing the largest set of characterized ZFPs from any organism described to date. These recognition motifs can be used to predict genomic binding sites for these factors within the fruit fly genome. Subsets of fingers from these ZFPs were characterized to define their orientation and register on their recognition sequences, thereby allowing us to define the recognition diversity within this finger set. We find that the characterized fingers can specify 47 of the 64 possible DNA triplets. To confirm the utility of our finger recognition models, we employed subsets of Drosophila fingers in combination with an existing archive of artificial zinc finger modules to create ZFPs with novel DNA-binding specificity. These hybrids of natural and artificial fingers can be used to create functional zinc finger nucleases for editing vertebrate genomes.
9572299	Modulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor by haloperidol: NR2B-specific interactions.	The dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol has an eight- to 10-fold higher affinity for NMDA receptors containing the NR2B (epsilon2) subunit, showing the same subunit specificity as ifenprodil, polyamines, and magnesium. In the present study, we have compared the effects of mutations altering polyamine and ifenprodil sensitivity on haloperidol sensitivity of NMDA receptors. As seen for spermidine stimulation, high-affinity haloperidol inhibition is governed by the region around amino acid 198, based on results from chimeric murine NR2A/NR2B (epislon1/epsilon2) receptors. Mutation of epsilon2E201 in this region to asparagine or arginine causes a 10-fold decrease in the ability of haloperidol to inhibit 125I-MK-801 binding. Epsilon2E201 does not govern the interactions of ifenprodil, because all of the mutants at epsilon2E201 exhibited wild-type affinity for ifenprodil. Mutation of epsilon2R337 causes a 400-fold loss in apparent affinity for ifenprodil but does not change the effects of haloperidol. The structural determinants of spermidine stimulation do not perfectly match those for haloperidol inhibition, as mutations of E200 remove haloperidol inhibition but do not alter polyamine stimulation. The present results thus demonstrate that although spermidine, haloperidol, and ifenprodil share subunit selectivity and overlapping pharmacology, they also have specific structural determinants.
10494488	Variations of progesterone receptor and c-fos gene expression in the rat uterus after treatment with norethisterone and its A-ring reduced metabolites.	It has been suggested that some contraceptive derivatives of 19-nor-testosterone possess estrogenic activity that may facilitate the development of breast cancer. The aim of this work was to investigate the estrogenic properties of norethisterone (NET) and its A-ring-reduced derivatives by determining progesterone receptor (PR) and c-fos mRNA content of two estrogen-regulated genes in the uterus of ovariectomized rats. mRNA content was evaluated by Northern blot 1-6 h after 17 beta-estradiol administration. The highest PR and c-fos mRNA content was observed 3 h and 2 h after 17 beta-estradiol administration, respectively. NET did not modify either PR or c-fos mRNA content. In contrast, 5 alpha- and 3 beta, 5 alpha-NET significantly increased mRNA content of both genes. The increase in c-fos mRNA content induced by these reduced compounds was lower than that found with estradiol treatment. The overall results indicate that NET administration can indirectly induce estrogenic effects through the action of its 5 alpha-dihydro and 3 beta, 5 alpha-tetrahydro derivatives.
23535185	Galangin attenuates mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation.	A great number of people are suffering from allergic inflammatory disease such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and sinusitis. Therefore discovery of drugs for the treatment of these diseases is an important subject in human health. In this study, we investigated anti-allergic inflammatory effect of galangin and underlying mechanisms of action using in vitro and in vivo models. Galangin inhibited histamine release by the reduction of intracellular calcium in phorbol 12-mystate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated human mast cells (HMC-1). Galangin decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and IL-8. The inhibitory effect of galangin on theses pro-inflammatory cytokines was related with c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-κB, and caspase-1. Furthermore, galangin attenuated IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and the expression of histamine receptor 1 at the inflamed tissue. The inhibitory effects of galangin were more potent than cromolyn, a known anti-allergic drug. Our results showed that galangin down-regulates mast cell-derived allergic inflammatory reactions by blocking histamine release and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In light of in vitro and in vivo anti-allergic inflammatory effects, galangin could be a beneficial anti-allergic inflammatory agent.
22977167	Effects of ozone and particulate matter on cardiac mechanics: role of the atrial natriuretic peptide gene.	A positive association between air pollution exposure and increased human risk of chronic heart disease progression is well established. In the current study, we test two hypotheses: (1) the cardiac compensatory changes in response to air pollution are dependent on its composition and (2) specific cardiac adaptations are regulated by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). We address these hypotheses by initially examining the exposure effects of ozone (O(3)) and/or particulate matter (PM) on cardiac function in C57Bl/6J (B6) mice. Subsequently, the results are compared with cardiac functional changes to the same exposures in Nppa (the precursor gene for ANP) knockout (KO) mice. Separate groups of mice underwent 3 consecutive days of the same exposure sequence for 3h each consisting of the following: (1) 6h of filtered air (FAFA), (2) O(3) then FA (O(3)FA), (3) FA then carbon black (FACB), or (4) O(3) then CB. Cardiac function was assessed using a conductance catheter to generate cardiac pressure-volume loops 8-10h following each exposure sequence. As compared with FAFA, each sequence led to a substantial drop (as much as 33%) in stroke volume and cardiac output. However, these losses of cardiac function occurred by different compensatory mechanisms dependent on the pollutant composition. For example, O(3)FA exposure led to reductions in both end-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular (LV) volumes, whereas FACB exposure led an increase in end-diastolic LV volume. These same cardiac compensatory changes were largely abolished in Nppa KO mice following O(3)FA or FACB exposure. These results suggest that cardiac functional changes in response to air pollution exposure are strongly dependent on the pollutant constituents, especially related to O(3) and/or PM. Furthermore, ANP regulation appears to be crucial to these cardiac compensatory mechanisms induced by air pollution.
20222714	Complexity in influenza virus targeted drug design: interaction with human sialidases.	With the global spread of the pandemic H1N1 and the ongoing pandemic potential of the H5N1 subtype, the influenza virus represents one of the most alarming viruses spreading worldwide. The influenza virus sialidase is an effective drug target, and a number of inhibitors are clinically effective against the virus (zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir). Here we report structural and biochemical studies of the human cytosolic sialidase Neu2 with influenza virus sialidase-targeting drugs and related compounds.
23333576	Areca nut procyanidins ameliorate streptozocin-induced hyperglycemia by regulating gluconeogenesis.	Hepatic gluconeogenesis is a major contributor to blood glucose in diabetes mellitus. Our previous study indicated that areca nut extract enriched with catechin-based procyanidins from oligomers to polymers gave rise to anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo. Here we have surveyed the molecular features of areca nut procyanidins (ANPs) using quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (Q-TOF LC/MS) and the resulting mass spectrum accurately described ANP from monomer to hexadecamer. Furthermore, the potential of ANP in terms of blood glucose homeostasis was explored using cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/dexamethasone stimulated primary mouse hepatocytes and multiple low dose streptozocin (MLD-STZ) treated mice. With the primary hepatocytes, ANP dose-dependently inhibited gluconeogenesis and reduced the mRNA expression of two gluconeogenic key enzymes, phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Intragastrically feeding of 10mg/kg ANP for 4weeks reduced the levels of fasting blood glucose, PEPCK and G6Pase in MLD-STZ mice. In additional, the level of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression showed a trend towards being restored in the ANP treated MLD-STZ-mice. This study indicated that ANP has the potential to improve hyperglycemia by regulating gluconeogenic related kinases in MLD-STZ-mice.
23071294	ApoE derived from adipose tissue does not suppress atherosclerosis or correct hyperlipidemia in apoE knockout mice.	The synthesis of apoE by adipocytes has profound effects on adipose tissue lipid flux and gene expression. Using adipose tissue transplantation from wild-type (WT) to apoE knockout (EKO) mice, we show that adipose tissue also contributes to circulating apoE. Different from circulating apoE produced by bone marrow transplantation (BMT), however, adipose tissue-derived apoE does not correct hyperlipidemia or suppress atherosclerosis. ApoE secreted by macrophages has a more acidic isoform distribution, and it increases binding of reconstituted VLDL particles to hepatocytes and fibroblasts more effectively than apoE secreted by adipocytes. The incremental binding can be entirely accounted for by binding to the LDL receptor. After BMT into EKO hosts, plasma cholesterol and macrophage-derived apoE are largely within IDL/LDL- and HDL-sized particles. After adipose tissue transplantation, most cholesterol and adipocyte apoE remain in VLDL. After BMT, circulating apoE no longer demonstrates predominance of acidic isoforms compared with that circulating after fat transplantation. In conclusion, fat transplantation provides circulating apoE levels similar to those provided by bone marrow transplantation, but it does not suppress hyperlipidemia or atherosclerosis. A potential mechanism contributing to this difference is differential binding to cell surface lipoprotein receptors.
22935610	The prolyl-isomerase Pin1 activates the mitochondrial death program of p53.	In response to intense stress, the tumor protein p53 (p53) tumor suppressor rapidly mounts a direct mitochondrial death program that precedes transcription-mediated apoptosis. By eliminating severely damaged cells, this pathway contributes to tumor suppression as well as to cancer cell killing induced by both genotoxic drugs and non-genotoxic p53-reactivating molecules. Here we have explored the role had in this pathway by the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 (peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase, NIMA-interacting 1), a crucial transducer of p53's phosphorylation into conformational changes unleashing its pro-apoptotic activity. We show that Pin1 promotes stress-induced localization of p53 to mitochondria both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, we demonstrate that upon stress-induced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser46 by homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2, Pin1 stimulates its mitochondrial trafficking signal, that is, monoubiquitination. This pathway is induced also by the p53-activating molecule RITA, and we demonstrate the strong requirement of Pin1 for the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis by this compound. These findings have significant implications for treatment of p53-expressing tumors and for prospective use of p53-activating compounds in clinics.
23132743	Ligand-dependent actions of the vitamin D receptor are required for activation of TGF-β signaling during the inflammatory response to cutaneous injury.	The vitamin D receptor (VDR) has both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-dependent and -independent actions in the epidermis. Ligand-dependent actions of the VDR have been shown to promote keratinocyte differentiation and to regulate formation of the epidermal barrier. In contrast, the actions of the VDR that regulate postmorphogenic hair cycling do not require 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The VDR also has immunomodulatory actions that are dependent on its ligand, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. To determine whether the ligand-dependent or -independent actions of the VDR regulate the inflammatory response to cutaneous injury, studies were performed in control, VDR knockout, and vitamin D-deficient mice. These investigations demonstrate that absence of receptor or ligand impairs the dermal response to cutaneous injury. Although neutrophil recruitment is not affected, the absence of VDR signaling leads to defects in macrophage recruitment and granulation tissue formation. Studies performed to identify the molecular basis for this phenotype demonstrate that absence of the VDR, or its ligand, impairs TGF-β signaling in the dermis, characterized by decreased expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and reduced phosphorylation of phosphorylated Smad-3 as well as attenuated phosphorylated Smad-3 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β in primary dermal fibroblasts lacking the VDR. Thus, these data demonstrate that the liganded VDR interacts with the TGF-β signaling pathway to promote the normal inflammatory response to cutaneous injury.
6706930	Mechanism of iodide-dependent catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase.	Mechanisms that have been proposed for peroxidase-catalyzed iodination require the utilization of 1 mol of H2O2 for organic binding of 1 mol of iodide. When we measured the stoichiometry of this reaction using thyroid peroxidase or lactoperoxidase at pH 7.0, we consistently obtained a ratio less than 1.0. This was shown to be attributable to catalase-like activity of these enzymes, resulting in unproductive cleavage of H2O2. This catalatic activity was completely iodide-dependent. To elucidate the mechanism of the iodide-dependent catalatic activity, the effects of various agents were investigated. The major observations may be summarized as follows: 1) The catalatic activity was inhibited in the presence of an iodine acceptor such as tyrosine. 2) The pseudohalide, SCN-, could not replace I- as a promoter of catalatic activity. 3) The inhibitory effects of the thioureylene drugs, methimazole and carbimazole, on the iodide-dependent catalatic activity were very similar to those reported previously for thyroid peroxidase-catalyzed iodination. 4) High concentrations of I- inhibited the catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase in a manner similar to that described previously for peroxidase-catalyzed iodination. On the basis of these observations and other findings, we have proposed a scheme which offers a possible explanation for iodide-dependent catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase. Compound I of the peroxidases is represented as EO, and oxidation of I- by EO is postulated to form enzyme-bound hypoiodite, represented in our scheme as [EOI]-. We suggest that the latter can react with H2O2 in a catalase-like reaction, with evolution of O2. We postulate further that the same form of oxidized iodine is also involved in iodination of tyrosine, oxidation of thioureylene drugs, and oxidation of I-, and that inhibition of catalatic activity by these agents occurs through competition with H2O2 for oxidized iodine.
23265880	A new single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging agent for serotonin transporters: [(125)I]Flip-IDAM, (2-((2-((dimethylamino)methyl)-4-iodophenyl)thio)phenyl)methanol.	New ligands for in vivo brain imaging of serotonin transporter (SERT) with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) were prepared and evaluated. An efficient synthesis and radiolabeling of a biphenylthiol, FLIP-IDAM, 4, was accomplished. The affinity of FLIP-IDAM was evaluated by an in vitro inhibitory binding assay using [(125)I]-IDAM as radioligand in rat brain tissue homogenates (K(i) = 0.03 nM). New [(125)I]Flip-IDAM exhibited excellent binding affinity to SERT binding sites with a high hypothalamus to cerebellum ratio of 4 at 30 min post iv injection. The faster in vivo kinetics for brain uptake and a rapid washout from non-specific regions provide excellent signal to noise ratio. This new agent, when labeled with (123)I, may be a useful imaging agent for mapping SERT binding sites in the human brain.
17434872	Molecular determinants for the selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 by lumiracoxib.	Lumiracoxib is the first example of a marketed COX-2 inhibitor of the arylacetic acid class, and it is reported to be the most selective COXIB in vivo. However, the molecular basis of its COX-2 inhibition has not been completely defined. Using standard assays, lumiracoxib was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified ovine COX-1 and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified human COX-2. The extent of COX-2 inhibition plateaued at around 50% and suggested that the inhibitor may be reversibly bound to the enzyme. Kinetic studies with lumiracoxib demonstrated that it was a time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibitor of human COX-2 that exhibited at least two binding steps during inhibition. Derivatives of lumiracoxib were synthesized with or without the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring and with various substitutions on the lower aniline ring. Inhibition studies demonstrated that the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring is required for COX-2 selectivity. The chemical identity and position of the substituents on the lower aniline ring were important in determining the potency and extent of COX inhibition as well as COX-2 selectivity. Mutation of Ser-530 to Ala or Val-349 to Ala or Leu abolished the potent inhibition observed with wild-type human COX-2 and key lumiracoxib analogs. Interestingly, a Val-349 to Ile mutant was inhibited with equal potency to human COX-2 with 2,6-dichloro-, 2,6-dimethyl-, or 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of lumiracoxib, actually showed an increase in potency. Taken together with a recent crystal structure of a lumiracoxib-COX-2 complex, the kinetic analyses presented herein of the inhibition of mutant COX-2s by lumiracoxib allows the definition of the molecular basis of COX-2 inhibition.
23602989	Presynaptic CaMKIIα modulates dopamine D3 receptor activation in striatonigral terminals of the rat brain in a Ca(2+) dependent manner.	CaMKIIα is expressed at high density in the nucleus accumbens where it binds to postsynaptic D3 receptors inhibiting their effects. In striatonigral projections, activation of presynaptic D3 receptors potentiates D1 receptor-induced stimulation of cAMP production and GABA release. In this study we examined whether the presynaptic effects of D3 receptor stimulation in the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) are modulated by Ca(2+) activation of CaMKIIα. In SNr synaptosomes two procedures that increase cytoplasmic Ca(2+), ionomycin and K(+)-depolarization, blocked the additional stimulation of cAMP accumulation produced by coactivating D3 and D1 dopamine receptors. The selective CaMKIIα inhibitor KN-62 reversed the blockade produced by ionomycin and K(+)-depolarization. Incubation in either Ca(2) -free solutions or with the selective Ca(2+) blocker nifedipine, also reversed the blocking effects of K(+)-depolarization. Immunoblot studies showed that K(+)-depolarization increased CaMKIIα phosphorylation in a KN-62 sensitive manner and promoted CaMKIIα binding to D3 receptors. In K(+)-depolarized tissues, D3 receptors potentiated D1 receptor-induced stimulation of [(3)H]GABA release only when CaMKIIα was blocked with KN-62. In the presence of this inhibitor, the selective D3 agonist PD 128,907 reduced the ED50 for the D1 agonist SKF 38393 from 56 to 4 nM. KN-62 also enhanced the effects of dopamine on depolarization induced [(3)H]GABA release. KN-62 changed ED50 for dopamine from 584 to 56 nM. KN-62 did not affect D1 and D4 receptor responses. These experiments show that in striatonigral projections, CaMKIIα inhibits the action of D3 receptors in a Ca(2+) dependent manner blocking their modulatory effects on GABA release. These findings suggest a mechanism through which the frequency of action potential discharge in presynaptic terminals regulates dopamine effects.
9079657	Activation-dependent exposure of the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Leu88 in factor Xa mediates ligand binding to effector cell protease receptor-1.	Binding of factor Xa to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is contributed by effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1). The structural requirements of this recognition were investigated. Factor Xa or catalytically inactive 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1sulfonyl (dansyl) Glu-Gly-Arg-(DEGR)-chloromethylketone-factor Xa bound indistinguishably to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants, and inhibited equally well the binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells. Similarly, factor Xa active site inhibitors TAP or NAP5 did not reduce ligand binding to EPR-1. A factor X peptide duplicating the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Phe84-Thr85-Arg86-Lys87-Leu88- (Gly) inhibited factor V/Va-independent prothrombin activation by HUVEC and blocked binding of 125I-factor Xa to these cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 20-40 microM). In contrast, none of the other factor X peptides tested or a control peptide with the inter-EGF sequence in scrambled order was effective. A recombinant chimeric molecule expressing the factor X sequence Leu83-Leu88 within a factor IX backbone inhibited binding of 125I-factor Xa to HUVEC and EPR-1 transfectants in a dose-dependent fashion, while recombinant factor IX or plasma IXa had no effect. An antibody generated against the factor X peptide 83-88, and designated JC15, inhibited 125I-factor Xa binding to HUVEC. The JC15 antibody bound to factor Xa and the recombinant IX/X83-88 chimera in a concentration dependent manner, while no specific reactivity with factors X or IXa was observed. Furthermore, binding of 125I-factor Xa to immobilized JC15 was inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled factor Xa, but not by comparable concentrations of factors X or IXa. These findings identify the inter-EGF sequence Leu83-Leu88 in factor Xa as a novel recognition site for EPR-1, and suggest its potential role as a protease activation-dependent neo-epitope. This interacting motif may help elucidate the contribution of factor Xa to cellular assembly of coagulation and vascular injury.
18568240	Insights into the regulation of TNF-alpha production in human mononuclear cells: the effects of non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibition.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibition on transcription factor activation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human mononuclear cells. INTRODUCTION: The production of TNF-alpha following LPS stimulation is one of the key steps in bacterial sepsis and inflammation. The mechanism by which phosphodiesterase inhibition alters TNF-alpha production in the presence of LPS remains unclear. METHODS: Human mononuclear cells were stimulated with LPS (1 microg/mL), in the presence and absence of Pentoxifylline (PTX; 20 mM), a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Western blotting of phosphorylated cytoplasmic I-kBalpha, nuclear factor-kB p65 (NF-kB), and nuclear cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) was performed. DNA binding of NF-kB and CREB was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. TNF-a levels were determined in the supernatant of stimulated cells in the presence and absence Protein kinase A inhibition by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: PTX was demonstrated to significantly reduce cytoplasmic I-kBalpha phosphorylation, nuclear p65 phosphorylation, and the DNA binding activity of NF-kB. In contrast, PTX markedly enhanced the phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of CREB. Cells concomitantly treated with PTX and LPS secreted similar levels of TNF-a in the presence and absence Protein kinase A inhibition. DISCUSSION: The increased level of cAMP that results from phosphodiesterase inhibition affects cytoplasmic and nuclear events, resulting in the attenuation of NF-kB and the activation of CREB transcriptional DNA binding through pathways that are partially Protein kinase A-independent. CONCLUSION: PTX-mediated phosphodiesterase inhibition occurs partially through a Protein kinase A-independent pathway and may serve as a useful tool in the attenuation of LPS-induced inflammation.
16530878	Direct molecular and spectroscopic evidence for increased ammonia removal capacity of skeletal muscle in acute liver failure.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: It has been proposed that, in acute liver failure, skeletal muscle adapts to become the principle organ responsible for removal of blood-borne ammonia by increasing glutamine synthesis, a reaction that is catalyzed by the cytosolic ATP-dependent enzyme glutamine synthetase. To address this issue, glutamine synthetase expression and activities were measured in skeletal muscle of rats with acute liver failure resulting from hepatic devascularization. METHODS: Glutamine synthetase protein and gene expression were investigated using immunoblotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Glutamine synthetase activity and glutamine de novo synthesis were measured using, respectively, a standard enzymatic assay and [13C]-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: Glutamine synthetase protein (but not gene) expression and enzyme activities were significantly up-regulated leading to increased de novo synthesis of glutamine and increased skeletal muscle capacity for ammonia removal in acute liver failure. In contrast to skeletal muscle, expression and activities of glutamine synthetase in the brain were significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that skeletal muscle adapts, through a rapid induction of glutamine synthetase, to increase its capacity for removal of blood-borne ammonia in acute liver failure. Maintenance of muscle mass together with the development of agents with the capacity to stimulate muscle glutamine synthetase could provide effective ammonia-lowering strategies in this disorder.
19445548	Atomoxetine: a review of its use in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents.	Atomoxetine (Strattera(R)) is a selective norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor that is not classified as a stimulant, and is indicated for use in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atomoxetine is effective and generally well tolerated. It is significantly more effective than placebo and standard current therapy and does not differ significantly from or is noninferior to immediate-release methylphenidate; however, it is significantly less effective than the extended-release methylphenidate formulation OROS(R) methylphenidate (hereafter referred to as osmotically released methylphenidate) and extended-release mixed amfetamine salts. Atomoxetine can be administered either as a single daily dose or split into two evenly divided doses, has a negligible risk of abuse or misuse, and is not a controlled substance in the US. Atomoxetine is particularly useful for patients at risk of substance abuse, as well as those who have co-morbid anxiety or tics, or who do not wish to take a controlled substance. Thus, atomoxetine is a useful option in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents. The mechanism of action of atomoxetine is unclear, but is thought to be related to its selective inhibition of presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake in the prefrontal cortex. Atomoxetine has a high affinity and selectivity for norepinephrine transporters, but little or no affinity for various neurotransmitter receptors. Atomoxetine has a demonstrated ability to selectively inhibit norepinephrine uptake in humans and animals, and studies have shown that it preferentially binds to areas of known high distribution of noradrenergic neurons, such as the fronto-cortical subsystem. Atomoxetine was generally associated with statistically, but not clinically, significant increases in both heart rate and blood pressure in pediatric patients with ADHD. While there was an initial loss in expected height and weight among atomoxetine recipients, this eventually returned to normal in the longer term. Data suggest that atomoxetine is unlikely to have any abuse potential. Atomoxetine appeared less likely than methylphenidate to exacerbate disordered sleep in pediatric patients with ADHD. Atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed, and demonstrates dose-proportional increases in plasma exposure. It undergoes extensive biotransformation, which is affected by poor metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 in a small percentage of the population; these patients have greater exposure to and slower elimination of atomoxetine than extensive metabolizers. Patients with hepatic insufficiency show an increase in atomoxetine exposure. CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as paroxetine, are associated with changes in atomoxetine pharmacokinetics similar to those observed among poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. Once- or twice-daily atomoxetine was effective in the short-term treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents, as observed in several well designed placebo-controlled trials. Atomoxetine also demonstrated efficacy in the longer term treatment of these patients. A single morning dose was shown to be effective into the evening, and discontinuation of atomoxetine was not associated with symptom rebound. Atomoxetine efficacy did not appear to differ between children and adolescents. Stimulant-naive patients also responded well to atomoxetine treatment. Atomoxetine did not differ significantly from or was noninferior to immediate-release methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD with regard to efficacy, and was significantly more effective than standard current therapy (any combination of medicines [excluding atomoxetine] and/or behavioral counseling, or no treatment). However, atomoxetine was significantly less effective than osmotically released methylphenidate and extended-release mixed amfetamine salts. The efficacy of atomoxetine did not appear to be affected by the presence of co-morbid disorders, and symptoms of the co-morbid disorders were not affected or were improved by atomoxetine administration. Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) appeared to be positively affected by atomoxetine in both short- and long-term studies; atomoxetine also improved HR-QOL to a greater extent than standard current therapy. Atomoxetine was generally well tolerated in children and adolescents with ADHD. Common adverse events included headache, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, vomiting, somnolence, and nausea. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate; there was a very low incidence of serious adverse events. Few patients discontinued atomoxetine treatment because of adverse events. Atomoxetine discontinuation appeared to be well tolerated, with a low incidence of discontinuation-emergent adverse events. Atomoxetine appeared better tolerated among extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers than among poor metabolizers. Slight differences were evident in the adverse event profiles of atomoxetine and stimulants, both immediate- and extended-release. Somnolence appeared more common among atomoxetine recipients and insomnia appeared more common among stimulant recipients. A black-box warning for suicidal ideation has been published in the US prescribing information, based on findings from a meta-analysis showing that atomoxetine is associated with a significantly higher incidence of suicidal ideation than placebo. Rarely, atomoxetine may also be associated with serious liver injury; postmarketing data show that three patients have had liver-related adverse events deemed probably related to atomoxetine treatment. Treatment algorithms involving the initial use of atomoxetine appear cost effective versus algorithms involving initial methylphenidate (immediate- or extended-release), dexamfetamine, tricyclic antidepressants, or no treatment in stimulant-naive, -failed, and -contraindicated children and adolescents with ADHD. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year is below commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds, as shown in several Markov model analyses conducted from the perspective of various European countries, with a time horizon of 1 year.
23348514	Effects of metformin on burn-induced hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress in male rats.	Severe burn injury causes hepatic dysfunction that results in major metabolic derangements including insulin resistance and hyperglycemia and is associated with hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We have recently shown that insulin reduces ER stress and improves liver function and morphology; however, it is not clear whether these changes are directly insulin mediated or are due to glucose alterations. Metformin is an antidiabetic agent that decreases hyperglycemia by different pathways than insulin; therefore, we asked whether metformin affects postburn ER stress and hepatic metabolism. The aim of the present study is to determine the effects of metformin on postburn hepatic ER stress and metabolic markers. Male rats were randomized to sham, burn injury and burn injury plus metformin and were sacrificed at various time points. Outcomes measured were hepatic damage, function, metabolism and ER stress. Burn-induced decrease in albumin mRNA and increase in alanine transaminase (p < 0.01 versus sham) were not normalized by metformin treatment. In addition, ER stress markers were similarly increased in burn injury with or without metformin compared with sham (p < 0.05). We also found that gluconeogenesis and fatty acid metabolism gene expressions were upregulated with or without metformin compared with sham (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that, whereas thermal injury results in hepatic ER stress, metformin does not ameliorate postburn stress responses by correcting hepatic ER stress.
17273750	Cimetidine induces apoptosis of human salivary gland tumor cells.	It has been reported that cimetidine, a histamine type-2 receptor (H2R) antagonist, inhibits the growth of glandular tumors such as colorectal cancer. However, its effects against salivary gland tumors are still unknown. We demonstrated previously that human salivary gland tumor (HSG) cells spontaneously express the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and also that HSG cell proliferation could be controlled via a homophilic (NCAM-NCAM) binding mechanism and that NCAM may be associated with perineural invasion by malignant salivary gland tumors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of cimetidine via the expression of NCAM on tumor growth and perineural/neural invasion in salivary gland tumor cells. Expression of both NCAM mRNA and protein was found to decrease in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with cimetidine for 24 h. The MTT assay and confocal laser microscopy clearly showed that HSG cells underwent apoptosis after treatment with cimetidine. Activation of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9 was observed in HSG cells after cimetidine treatment, thus confirming that the apoptosis was induced by the activated caspases. Apaf-1 activity was also detected in HSG cells in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with cimetidine. We also found that the cimetidine-mediated down-regulation of NCAM expression in HSG cells did not occur via blocking of the histamine receptor, even though H2R expression was observed on HSG cells, as two other H2R antagonists, famotidine and ranitidine, did not show similar effects. We demonstrated for the first time that cimetidine can induce significant apoptosis of salivary gland tumor cells, which express NCAM, at least in part by down-regulation of NCAM expression on the cells. These findings suggest that the growth, development and perineural/neural invasion of salivary gland tumor cells can be blocked by cimetidine administration through down-regulation of NCAM expression, as well as induction of apoptosis.
17620346	Covalent binding of rofecoxib, but not other cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, to allysine aldehyde in elastin of human aorta.	In rats, it has been reported that rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, reacts with the aldehyde group of allysine in elastin to give a condensation covalent adduct, thereby preventing the formation of cross-linkages in the elastin and causing degradation of the elastic fibers in aortas in vivo. Acid, organic solvent, and proteolytic enzyme treatments of human aortic homogenate after incubation with [(14)C]rofecoxib demonstrated that most of the radioactivity is covalently bound to elastin. The in vitro covalent binding was inhibited in the presence of beta-aminopropionitrile, D-penicillamine, and hydralazine, which suggested that the aldehyde group of allysine in human elastin was relevant to the covalent binding. The in vitro covalent binding of [(14)C]rofecoxib was significantly decreased by the addition of only nonradiolabeled rofecoxib but not the other COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib, valdecoxib, etoricoxib, and CS-706 [2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl 1-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-1H-pyrrole], a novel selective COX-2 inhibitor. All the above COX-2 inhibitors except for rofecoxib had no reactivity with the aldehyde group of benzaldehyde used as a model compound of allysine aldehyde under a physiological pH condition. On the other hand, no retention of the radioactivity of [(14)C]rofecoxib was observed in human aortic endothelial cells in vitro, suggesting that rofecoxib is not retained in aortic endothelial cells in vivo. These results suggest that rofecoxib, but not other COX-2 inhibitors, is capable of covalently binding to the aldehyde group of allysine in human elastin. This might be one of the main causes of cardiovascular events by rofecoxib in clinical situations.
23477619	DNA Adducts in Aldehyde Dehydrogenase-Positive Lung Stem Cells of A/J Mice Treated with the Tobacco Specific Lung Carcinogen 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK).	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world. Evidence suggests that lung cancer could originate from mutations accumulating in a subpopulation of self-renewing cells, lung stem cells. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a marker of stem cells. To investigate the presence of DNA modifications in these cells, we isolated ALDH-positive lung cells from A/J mice exposed to the lung carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. Using LC-NSI-HRMS/MS-PRM, O(6)-methyl-G, 7-POB-G, and O(2)-POB-dT were positively identified in ALDH-positive cell DNA. This is the first example of detection of carcinogen-DNA adducts in lung stem cells, supporting the hypothesis of their role in lung carcinogenesis.
18684057	Optimizing denileukin diftitox (Ontak) therapy.	Denileukin diftitox (Ontak) is a novel recombinant fusion protein consisting of peptide sequences for the enzymatically active and membrane translocation domain of diphtheria toxin linked to human IL-2. Denileukin diftitox specifically binds to IL-2 receptors on the cell membrane, is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and inhibits protein synthesis by ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2, resulting in cell death. This article focuses on the clinical trial that led to the US FDA approval of the drug for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in 1999, and other investigational studies for hematologic malignancies, recurrent and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, graft-versus-host disease and autoimmune disease, demonstrating the activity and adverse effects of the drug.
17181139	Scaffold of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor carprofen provides Alzheimer gamma-secretase modulators.	N-sulfonylated and N-alkylated carprofen derivatives were investigated for their inhibition and modulation of gamma-secretase, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. The introduction of a lipophilic substituent transformed the COX-2 inhibitor carprofen into a potent gamma-secretase modulator. Several compounds (e.g., 9p, 11f) caused selective reduction of Abeta42 and an increase of Abeta38. The most active compounds displayed activities in the low micromolar range and no effect on the gamma-secretase cleavage at the e-site.
16973729	Hyperphagia alters expression of hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor genes and plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in Ay mice.	The central melanocortin (MC) pathway is suggested to mediate satiety signaling downstream of serotonin (5-HT)2C receptors. 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice consume more food, which leads to late-onset obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Ay mice with ectopic expression of the agouti peptide, which leads to a perturbation of the central MC pathway, develop obesity and diabetes, associated with low levels of plasma total ghrelin. Here, we report that 5-wk-old Ay mice consumed more food in association with decreases in levels of plasma des-acyl ghrelin, but not active ghrelin, and increases in hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor gene expression compared with wild-type mice matched for age and body weight. These alterations were also observed in 8-wk-old obese Ay mice. Restricted feeding significantly decreased hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor gene expression in association with a reversal of the decreases in plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in 5-wk-old Ay mice. Moreover, restricted feeding reduced body weight, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia in association with increases in plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in 8-wk-old obese Ay mice. Administration of m-chlorophenylpiperazine and fenfluramine, both of which induce anorexic effects via 5-HT2C receptors and/or 5-HT1B receptors, suppressed food intake in 5- and 8-wk-old Ay mice, whereas the anorexic effects were attenuated in food-restricted Ay mice. These findings suggest that the agouti peptide down-regulates hypothalamic 5-HT2C and 5-HT1B receptor gene expression under restricted feeding conditions, whereas chronic hyperphagia increases the expression of these genes and decreases plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels in Ay mice.
23376438	Cellular mechanisms of the cytotoxic effects of the zearalenone metabolites α-zearalenol and β-zearalenol on RAW264.7 macrophages.	Zearalenone (ZEN) and its metabolites are commonly found in many food commodities and are known to cause reproductive disorders and genotoxic effects. The major ZEN metabolites are α-zearalenol (α-ZOL) and β-zearalenol (β-ZOL). Although many studies have demonstrated the cytotoxic effects of these metabolites, the mechanisms by which α-ZOL or β-ZOL mediates their cytotoxic effects appear to differ according to cell type and the exposed toxins. We evaluated the toxicity of α-ZOL and β-ZOL on RAW264.7 macrophages and investigated the underlying mechanisms. β-ZOL not only more strongly reduced the viability of cells than did α-ZOL, but it also induced cell death mainly by apoptosis rather than necrosis. The ZEN metabolites induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial changes in Bcl-2 and Bax proteins, and cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Use of an inhibitor specific to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 kinase or p53, but not pan-caspase or caspase-8, decreased the toxin-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also attenuated the α-ZOL- or β-ZOL-induced decrease of cell viability. Antioxidative enzyme or compounds such as catalase, acteoside, and (E)-1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)-3-(4-hydroxystyryl)urea suppressed the ZEN metabolite-mediated reduction of cell viability. Further, knockdown of AIF via siRNA transfection diminished the ZEN metabolite-induced cell death. Collectively, these results suggest that the activation of p53, JNK or p38 kinase by ZEN metabolites is the main upstream signal required for the mitochondrial alteration of Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathways and intracellular ROS generation, while MMP loss and nuclear translocation of AIF are the critical downstream events for ZEN metabolite-mediated apoptosis in macrophages.
11146120	Pharmacological modulation of nerve growth factor synthesis: a mechanistic comparison of vitamin D receptor and beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists.	Increasing nerve growth factor (NGF) in the PNS is a rational strategy for treating certain neurodegenerative disorders. The present studies were undertaken to compare two compounds, a vitamin D(3) analogue (CB1093) with minimal calcaemic effects, and clenbuterol, a long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, both of which induce NGF synthesis in vivo. Clenbuterol caused significant increases in both NGF mRNA and protein in 3T3 cells; with maxima at 10 nM and at 8-12 h exposure. Effects of clenbuterol on NGF mRNA were antagonized by propranolol. Mobility shift assays on whole cell extracts showed that clenbuterol increased AP1 binding in 3T3 cells prior to increasing NGF synthesis. Clenbuterol was without effect on NGF mRNA levels in L929 cells, whereas CB1093 caused significant increases in both NGF mRNA and protein levels in both 3T3 and L929 cells. Stimulation was almost maximal at 24 h exposure and was sustained for at least 72 h. The magnitude of the increase was much greater in L929 (700% increase) than in 3T3 cells (80%). Binding to the vitamin D nuclear receptor (VDR), which acts as a transcription factor itself, was increased as early as 30 min after exposure to of CB1093 and maintained up to 24 h. Increased VDR binding preceded increased NGF mRNA. A 150% increase in AP-1 binding was also evident. This study demonstrates that CB1093 and clenbuterol stimulate NGF levels in vitro and that AP-1 binding could be a commonality between the mechanism of NGF induction of these two compounds.
23300056	Determination of key receptor-ligand interactions of dopaminergic arylpiperazines and the dopamine D2 receptor homology model.	Interest in structure-based G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand discovery is huge, given that almost 30 % of all approved drugs belong to this category of active compounds. The GPCR family includes the dopamine receptor subtype D2 (D2DR), but unfortunately--as is true of most GPCRs--no experimental structures are available for these receptors. In this publication, we present the molecular model of D2DR based on the previously published crystal structure of the dopamine D3 receptor (D3DR). A molecular modeling study using homology modeling and docking simulation provided a rational explanation for the behavior of the arylpiperazine ligand. The observed binding modes and receptor-ligand interactions provided us with fresh clues about how to optimize selectivity for D2DR receptors.
15299009	A disorder to order transition accompanies catalysis in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type II.	Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase II (RalDH2) converts retinal to the transcriptional regulator retinoic acid in the developing embryo. The x-ray structure of the enzyme revealed an important structural difference between this protein and other aldehyde dehydrogenases of the same enzyme superfamily; a 20-amino acid span in the substrate access channel in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase II is disordered, whereas in other aldehyde dehydrogenases this region forms a well defined wall of the substrate access channel. We asked whether this disordered loop might order during the course of catalysis and provide a means for an enzyme that requires a large substrate access channel to restrict access to the catalytic machinery by smaller compounds that might potentially enter the active site and be metabolized. Our experiments, a combination of kinetic, spectroscopic, and crystallographic techniques, suggest that a disorder to order transition is linked to catalytic activity.
10740137	Statins: effective antiatherosclerotic therapy.	BACKGROUND: Statins are the most effective agents currently available for lowering plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and are the mainstay of therapy for hyperlipidemia. The statins are highly liver-selective, inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol. Several large, controlled clinical trials have confirmed significant reductions in rates of coronary heart disease morbidity and death with long-term statin therapy in patients with mild to severe hypercholesterolemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: This review article is based on a literature search of more than 60 relevant articles from peer-reviewed journals. Search engines included Medline and Embase. In surveying clinical and angiographic evidence, we found that statins appear to reduce the incidence of coronary events by slowing the progression of atherosclerosis and preventing atheromatous lesion formation. We found that the 6 statins currently marketed-atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin-differ in their inhibitory action on the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: The use of more potent statins such as atorvastatin and simvastatin affords greater lowering of LDL-C and triglyceride levels, allowing more patients to achieve target goals. The question of how low LDL-C levels should be lowered will be answered by ongoing clinical trials.
23558236	Design, synthesis and cytotoxicity of cell death mechanism of rotundic acid derivatives.	In the present investigation, 16 new rotundic acid (RA) derivatives modified at the C-3, C-23 and C-28 positions were synthesized. The cytotoxicities of the derivatives were evaluated against HeLa, A375, HepG2, SPC-A1 and NCI-H446 human tumor cell lines by MTT assay. Among these derivatives, compounds 4-7 exhibited stronger cell growth inhibitory than RA and compound 4 was found to be the best inhibition activity on five human tumor cell lines with IC50 <10μM. The apoptosis mechanism of compound 4 in HeLa cells was investigated by western blot analysis. The results indicated that compound 4 could induce apoptosis through increasing protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, and decreasing protein expression of Bcl-2. In summary, the present work suggests that compound 4 might serve as an effective chemotherapeutic candidate.
23391443	An intra-articular salmon calcitonin-based nanocomplex reduces experimental inflammatory arthritis.	Prolonged inappropriate inflammatory responses contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to aspects of osteoarthritis (OA). The orphan nuclear receptor, NR4A2, is a key regulator and potential biomarker for inflammation and represents a potentially valuable therapeutic target. Both salmon calcitonin (sCT) and hyaluronic acid (HA) attenuated activated mRNA expression of NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 3 and 13 in three human cell lines: SW1353 chondrocytes, U937 and THP-1 monocytes. Ad-mixtures of sCT and HA further down-regulated expression of NR4A2 compared to either agent alone at specific concentrations, hence the rationale for their formulation in nanocomplexes (NPs) using chitosan. The sCT released from NP stimulated cAMP production in human T47D breast cancer cells expressing sCT receptors. When NP were injected by the intra-articular (I.A.) route to the mouse knee during on-going inflammatory arthritis of the K/BxN serum transfer model, joint inflammation was reduced together with NR4A2 expression, and local bone architecture was preserved. These data highlight remarkable anti-inflammatory effects of sCT and HA at the level of reducing NR4A2 mRNA expression in vitro. Combining them in NP elicits anti-arthritic effects in vivo following I.A. delivery.
23533219	Increased activin bioavailability enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity while inducing hepatic steatosis in male mice.	The development of insulin resistance is tightly linked to fatty liver disease and is considered a major health concern worldwide, although their mechanistic relationship remains controversial. Activin has emerging roles in nutrient homeostasis but its metabolic effects on hepatocytes remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of increased endogenous activin bioactivity on hepatic nutrient homeostasis by creating mice with inactivating mutations that deplete the circulating activin antagonists, follistatin like-3 (FSTL3) or the follistatin 315 isoform (FST315; FST288-only mice). We investigated liver histology and lipid content, hepatic insulin sensitivity, and metabolic gene expression including the HepG2 cell and primary hepatocyte response to activin treatment. Both FSTL3KO and FST288-only mice had extensive hepatic steatosis and elevated hepatic triglyceride (TG) content. Unexpectedly, insulin signaling, as assessed by phospho-AKT, was enhanced in both mouse models. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with activin A increased their response to subsequent insulin challenge. Gene expression analysis suggests that increased lipid uptake, enhanced de novo lipid synthesis, decreased lipolysis and/or enhanced glucose uptake contribute to increased hepatic TG content in these models. However, activin treatment recapitulated only some of these gene changes suggesting that increased activin bioactivity may be only partially responsible for this phenotype. Nevertheless, our results indicate that activin enhances hepatocyte insulin response which ultimately leads to hepatic steatosis despite the increased insulin sensitivity. Thus, regulation of activin bioactivity is critical for maintaining normal liver lipid homeostasis and response to insulin while activin agonists may be useful for increasing liver insulin sensitivity.
17929831	Kinetic characterization of adenylosuccinate synthetase from the thermophilic archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii.	Adenylosuccinate synthetase (AdSS) catalyzes the Mg2+ dependent condensation of a molecule of IMP with aspartate to form adenylosuccinate, in a reaction driven by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. AdSS from the thermophilic archaea, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAdSS) is 345 amino acids long against an average length of 430-457 amino acids for most mesophilic AdSS. This short AdSS has two large deletions that map to the middle and C-terminus of the protein. This article discusses the detailed kinetic characterization of MjAdSS. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies, carried out at 70 degrees C, suggest a rapid equilibrium random AB steady-state ordered C kinetic mechanism for the MjAdSS catalyzed reaction. AdSS are known to exhibit monomer-dimer equilibrium with the dimer being implicated in catalysis. In contrast, our studies show that MjAdSS is an equilibrium mixture of dimers and tetramers with the tetramer being the catalytically active form. The tetramer dissociates into dimers with a minor increase in ionic strength of the buffer, while the dimer is extremely stable and does not dissociate even at 1.2 M NaCl. Phosphate, a product of the reaction, was found to be a potent inhibitor of MjAdSS showing biphasic inhibition of enzyme activity. The inhibition was competitive with IMP and noncompetitive with GTP. MjAdSS, like the mouse acidic isozyme, exhibits substrate inhibition, with IMP inhibiting enzyme activity at subsaturating GTP concentrations. Regulation of enzyme activity by the glycolytic intermediate, fructose 1,6 bisphosphate, was also observed with the inhibition being competitive with IMP and noncompetitive against GTP.
23265904	Discovery of liver-targeted inhibitors of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1).	Inhibitors based on a benzo-fused spirocyclic oxazepine scaffold were discovered for stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase 1 (SCD1) and subsequently optimized to potent compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and in vivo efficacy in reducing the desaturation index in a mouse model. Initial optimization revealed potency preferences for the oxazepine core and benzylic positions, while substituents on the piperidine portions were more tolerant and allowed for tuning of potency and PK properties. After preparation and testing of a range of functional groups on the piperidine nitrogen, three classes of analogs were identified with single digit nanomolar potency: glycine amides, heterocycle-linked amides, and thiazoles. Responding to concerns about target localization and potential mechanism-based side effects, an initial effort was also made to improve liver concentration in an available rat PK model. An advanced compound 17m with a 5-carboxy-2-thiazole substructure appended to the spirocyclic piperidine scaffold was developed which satisfied the in vitro and in vivo requirements for more detailed studies.
23231967	Selective and potent adenosine A3 receptor antagonists by methoxyaryl substitution on the N-(2,6-diarylpyrimidin-4-yl)acetamide scaffold.	The influence of diverse methoxyphenyl substitution patterns on the N-(2,6-diarylpyrimidin-4-yl)acetamide scaffold is herein explored in order to modulate the A(3) adenosine receptor antagonistic profile. As a result, novel ligands exhibiting excellent potency (K(i) on A(3) AR < 20 nM) and selectivity profiles (above 100-fold within the adenosine receptors family) are reported. Moreover, our joint theoretical and experimental approach allows the identification of novel pharmacophoric elements conferring A(3)AR selectivity, first established by a robust computational model and thereafter characterizing the most salient features of the structure-activity and structure-selectivity relationships in this series.
23505146	Diverse effects of macromolecular crowding on the sequential glycan-processing pathway involved in glycoprotein quality control.	Compared with in vitro conditions, the intracellular environment is highly crowded with biomolecules; this has numerous effects on protein functions, including enzymatic activity. We examined the effects of macromolecular crowding on glycan processing of N-glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum as a model sequential metabolic pathway. Experiments with synthetic substrates of physiological glycan structure clearly showed that the first half of the pathway (glucose trimming) was accelerated, whereas the second (mannose trimming) was decelerated under molecular crowding conditions. Furthermore, calreticulin, a lectin-like molecular chaperone, bound more strongly to a glycan-processing intermediate under these conditions. This study demonstrates the diverse effects of molecular crowding on sequential enzymatic processing, and the importance of the effects of macromolecular crowding on in vitro assays for understanding sequential metabolic pathways.
23508961	Agonist-induced Down-regulation of Endogenous Protein Kinase C α through an Endolysosomal Mechanism.	Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes undergo down-regulation upon sustained stimulation. Previous studies have pointed to the existence of both proteasome-dependent and -independent pathways of PKCα processing. Here we demonstrate that these down-regulation pathways are engaged in different subcellular compartments; proteasomal degradation occurs mainly at the plasma membrane, whereas non-proteasomal processing occurs in the perinuclear region. Using cholesterol depletion, pharmacological inhibitors, RNA interference, and dominant-negative mutants, we define the mechanisms involved in perinuclear accumulation of PKCα and identify the non-proteasomal mechanism mediating its degradation. We show that intracellular accumulation of PKCα involves at least two clathrin-independent, cholesterol/lipid raft-mediated pathways that do not require ubiquitination of the protein; one is dynamin-dependent and likely involves caveolae, whereas the other is dynamin- and small GTPase-independent. Internalized PKCα traffics through endosomes and is delivered to the lysosome for degradation. Supportive evidence includes (a) detection of the enzyme in EEA1-positive early endosomes, Rab7-positive late endosomes/multivesicular bodies, and LAMP1-positive lysosomes and (b) inhibition of its down-regulation by lysosome-disrupting agents and leupeptin. Only limited dephosphorylation of PKCα occurs during trafficking, with fully mature enzyme being the main target for lysosomal degradation. These studies define a novel and widespread mechanism of desensitization of PKCα signaling that involves endocytic trafficking and lysosome-mediated degradation of the mature, fully phosphorylated protein.
15686475	Effect of apocalmodulin on recombinant human brain glutamic acid decarboxylase.	In this work, we report that the recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-human L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (HGAD) isoforms, 65-kDa L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) (GST-HGAD65) fusion protein or free truncated HGAD65, were activated by apocalmodulin (ApoCaM) to an extent of 60%. Both truncated forms of GAD67 (tGAD67), HGAD67(Delta1-70) and HGAD67(Delta1-90), were markedly activated by ApoCaM to an extent of 141 and 85%, respectively, while GST-HGAD67 was not significantly affected. The activation appears to be due to an increase of GAD affinity for its cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). This conclusion is based on the following observations. Firstly, the V(max) of GAD was increased when ApoCaM was present whereas the affinity for the substrate, glutamate, was not affected. Secondly, the affinity of GAD for PLP was increased in the presence of ApoCaM. Thirdly, results from calmodulin-agarose affinity column chromatography studies indicated a direct interaction or binding between ApoCaM and GAD. Fourthly, ApoCaM was found to be copurified with GAD65/GAD67 by anti-GAD65/67 immunoaffinity column using rat brain extract. Hence, it is proposed that a conformational change is induced when ApoCaM interacts with GAD65 or tGAD67, resulting in an increase of GAD affinity for PLP and the activation of GAD. The physiological significance of the interaction between GAD and ApoCaM is discussed.
23281613	Two new ent-3,4-seco-labdane diterpenoids from Callicarpa nudiflora.	Two new ent-3,4-seco-labdane diterpenoids, methylcallicarpate (1) and callicarpic acid (2), were isolated from the leaves of Callicarpa nudiflora Hook et Arn. Their structures and relative configurations were established by analysis of spectroscopic data. Their absolute configurations were assigned by the application of the CD technique for the first time among the ent-3,4-seco-labdane-type diterpenes.
10208491	Genetic causes of mild hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with premature occlusive coronary artery diseases.	Elevated plasma homocysteine is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Although there is general agreement on the importance of micronutrients and genetic predisposition to elevated plasma homocysteine, the exact influence of the known prevalent mutations in genes which regulate homocysteine metabolism is not clear. We studied 376 cases of individuals with premature CAD with respect to their fasting and post-methionine load (PML) total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations. We also determined the presence or absence of the T833C and G919A mutations of the cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) gene, the C677T mutation of the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, and the A2756G transition of the B12 dependent methionine synthase (MS) gene. Our objectives were therefore both to confirm the relationship of plasma homocysteine with premature CAD and to examine the importance of genetic influence on both fasting and PML homocysteine. Approximately 32% of the CAD patients had fasting hyperhomocysteinemia and 16% had PML hyperhomocysteinemia. Of these, 8.5% had both forms of hyperhomocysteinemia (combined hyperhomocysteinemia). The T133C mutation in the CBS gene and the thermolabile C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene seem to play an important role in the subset of individuals with combined hyperhomocysteinemia. The A2756G transition in the MS gene is not associated with elevated plasma tHcy. Many cases (47%) of hyperhomocysteinemia are not associated with micronutrient deficiencies, impaired renal function, and/or currently known genetic mutations. Further work is needed to study whether unknown mutations, particularly those residing in the intronic sequences of the genes involved in homocysteine metabolism, other environmental factors, or interaction of gene, nutrient, and environmental factors may be the cause of currently unexplained cases of mild hyperhomocysteinemia.
23312283	Trimethylamine-N-oxide, a metabolite associated with atherosclerosis, exhibits complex genetic and dietary regulation.	Circulating trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels are strongly associated with atherosclerosis. We now examine genetic, dietary, and hormonal factors regulating TMAO levels. We demonstrate that two flavin mono-oxygenase family members, FMO1 and FMO3, oxidize trimethylamine (TMA), derived from gut flora metabolism of choline, to TMAO. Further, we show that FMO3 exhibits 10-fold higher specific activity than FMO1. FMO3 overexpression in mice significantly increases plasma TMAO levels while silencing FMO3 decreases TMAO levels. In both humans and mice, hepatic FMO3 expression is reduced in males compared to females. In mice, this reduction in FMO3 expression is due primarily to downregulation by androgens. FMO3 expression is induced by dietary bile acids by a mechanism that involves the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a bile acid-activated nuclear receptor. Analysis of natural genetic variation among inbred strains of mice indicates that FMO3 and TMAO are significantly correlated, and TMAO levels explain 11% of the variation in atherosclerosis.
9670923	Cloning and characterization of alpha1H from human heart, a member of the T-type Ca2+ channel gene family.	Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels exist as multigene families that share common structural features. Different Ca2+ channels are distinguished by their electrophysiology and pharmacology and can be classified as either low or high voltage-activated channels. Six alpha1 subunit genes cloned previously code for high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels; therefore, we have used a database search strategy to identify new Ca2+ channel genes, possibly including low voltage-activated (T-type) channels. A novel expressed sequence-tagged cDNA clone of alpha1G was used to screen a cDNA library, and in the present study, we report the cloning of alpha1H (or CavT.2), a low voltage-activated Ca2+ channel from human heart. Northern blots of human mRNA detected more alpha1H expression in peripheral tissues, such as kidney and heart, than in brain. We mapped the gene, CACNA1H, to human chromosome 16p13.3 and mouse chromosome 17. Expression of alpha1H in HEK-293 cells resulted in Ca2+ channel currents displaying voltage dependence, kinetics, and unitary conductance characteristic of native T-type Ca2+ channels. The alpha1H channel is sensitive to mibefradil, a nondihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker, with an IC50 of 1.4 micromol/L, consistent with the reported potency of mibefradil for T-type Ca2+ channels. Together with alpha1G, a rat brain T-type Ca2+ channel also cloned in our laboratory, these genes define a unique family of Ca2+ channels.
23541982	Potential diagnostic applications of side chain oxysterols analysis in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.	The neurospecific cholesterol 24-hydroxylase converts excess brain cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) which, via the liver X receptor (LXR), can increase the expression and synthesis of astrocyte ApoE. 24OHC effluxes directly from brain into plasma where it is considered an indicator of brain cholesterol turnover. It is reduced in neurodegenerative disease states proportionally to the severity of disease and the degree of brain atrophy. In the early phases of active disease, a higher rate of turnover may result in transitory increases in plasma 24OHC. Less than 1% of the total brain excretion of 24OHC occurs via the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) whereas almost all 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) excretion is dependent on the function of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Iincreased CSF oxysterols were found in patients with neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases in the presence of barrier dysfunction. In neurodegeneration, free cholesterol released from dying cells may engulf neurons. Cholesterol also increases Amyloid β (Aβ) deposition and tau pathology. ApoE, 24OHC, tau and soluble APP were correlated in Alzheimer disease (AD) samples. Excess of cholesterol converted into 24OHC may up-regulate ApoE synthesis which is a scavenger for Aβ and Tau. In AD this protective mechanism seems to be inefficient, probably due to the presence of high concentrations of 27OHC, microvascular dysfunction and the decreased efficiency of ApoE4 as lipid transporter and Aβ scavenger. 24OHC itself was cytotoxic. Analysis of side chain oxysterols in the CSF is likely to provided useful information about cholesterol metabolism and ApoE function in the pathogenesis of AD.
23411217	Peyer's patch-mediated intestinal immune system modulating activity of pectic-type polysaccharide from peel of Citrus unshiu.	An intestinal immune system modulating polysaccharide (CUI-3IIb-3-2, 18kDa) was purified from Citrus unshiu peel. CUI-3IIb-3-2 mainly comprised GalA, GlcA, Ara, Gal and Rha, and it consisted of 4-linked GalA, terminal Araf, 4- or 5-linked/3,4- or 3,5-branched Ara, terminal Gal, and 2-linked/2,4-branched Rha. After CUI-3IIb-3-2 digestion by endo-α-d-(1→4)-polygalacturonase, its hydrolysate was fractionated into PG-1 and PG-2. Methylation analyses of PG-1 and PG-2 using base-catalysed β-elimination suggested that CUI-3IIb-3-2 be assumed as pectic-type polysaccharide. Since the activities of PG-1 and PG-2 were potently decreased, the whole polysaccharide structure of CUI-3IIb-3-2 would be essential to maintain the activity. Meanwhile, when CUI-3IIb was orally administered in mice, bone marrow cell proliferation and GM-CSF/IL-6 production from Peyer's patch cell were significantly higher (1.76- and 2.03/2.51-fold, respectively) than a saline. Therefore, a pectic-type polysaccharide from citrus peel could stimulate Peyer's patches and produce hematopoietic growth factors resulted in bone marrow cell proliferation.
18549347	An expert opinion on safinamide in Parkinson's disease.	BACKGROUND: Dopamine replacement therapies (levodopa, dopamine receptor agonists, anticholinergics, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors) remain the cornerstones of therapeutic interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the treatment options for PD symptoms, a cure remains elusive. An optimal treatment would be one that combined relief in both motor and nonmotor symptoms with neuroprotective properties. Safinamide is an investigational drug for PD currently in development as add-on therapy to both dopamine agonists and levodopa. Safinamide is a unique molecule with a novel mode of action, targeting both dopaminergic and glutaminergic systems, and potentially provides motor symptom control. Preliminary results from experimental models suggest potential neuroprotective effects. Studies on the potential effects on nonmotor symptoms are ongoing. OBJECTIVE: To review the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics, and to evaluate the available clinical safety and efficacy results of safinamide. METHODS: A search of the electronic database MEDLINE (PubMed, no time limits) was performed on 14 December 2007. The full text of all citations was obtained for review. Furthermore, two abstracts on safinamide published as proceedings of a European conference were reviewed. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Safinamide is a promising investigational drug for PD with a novel mode of action. Early reports confirm the potential efficacy of safinamide in PD. Further studies on potential effects on cognition and neuroprotection are needed.
10368299	Structure of acetylcholinesterase complexed with E2020 (Aricept): implications for the design of new anti-Alzheimer drugs.	BACKGROUND: Several cholinesterase inhibitors are either being utilized for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease or are in advanced clinical trials. E2020, marketed as Aricept, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed, synthesized and evaluated by the Eisai Company in Japan. These inhibitors were designed on the basis of QSAR studies, prior to elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE). It significantly enhances performance in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction and has a high affinity for AChE, binding to both electric eel and mouse AChE in the nanomolar range. RESULTS: Our experimental structure of the E2020-TcAChE complex pinpoints specific interactions responsible for the high affinity and selectivity demonstrated previously. It shows that E2020 has a unique orientation along the active-site gorge, extending from the anionic subsite of the active site, at the bottom, to the peripheral anionic site, at the top, via aromatic stacking interactions with conserved aromatic acid residues. E2020 does not, however, interact directly with either the catalytic triad or the 'oxyanion hole', but only indirectly via solvent molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows, a posteriori, that the design of E2020 took advantage of several important features of the active-site gorge of AChE to produce a drug with both high affinity for AChE and a high degree of selectivity for AChE versus butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). It also delineates voids within the gorge that are not occupied by E2020 and could provide sites for potential modification of E2020 to produce drugs with improved pharmacological profiles.
23271742	Arsenic suppresses cell survival via Pirh2-mediated proteasomal degradation of ΔNp63 protein.	Transcription factor p63, a member of the p53 family, shares a high degree of sequence similarity with p53. Because of transcription from two distinct promoters, the p63 gene encodes two isoforms, TAp63 and ΔNp63. Although TAp63 acts as a tumor suppressor, ΔNp63 functions as an oncogene and is often overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, therapeutic agents targeting ΔNp63 might be used to manage tumors that overexpress ΔNp63. Here we found that arsenic trioxide, a frontline agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, inhibits ΔNp63 but not TAp63 expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, we found that arsenic trioxide decreases the stability of ΔNp63 protein via a proteasome-dependent pathway but has little effect on the level of ΔNp63 transcript. Furthermore, we found that arsenic trioxide activates the Pirh2 promoter and consequently induces Pirh2 expression. Consistent with this, we found that knockdown of Pirh2 inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 enhances, arsenic-induced degradation of ΔNp63 protein. Importantly, we found that knockdown of ΔNp63 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of ΔNp63 inhibits, growth suppression induced by arsenic. Together, these data suggest that arsenic degrades ΔNp63 protein at least in part via Pirh2-dependent proteolysis and that inhibition of ΔNp63 expression facilitates tumor cells to arsenic-induced death.
23639249	Indoxyl 3-sulfate stimulates Th17 differentiation enhancing phosphorylation of c-Src and STAT3 to worsen experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.	Although AhR activation regulates CD4T cell differentiation, how it works has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, using in vitro Th17 differentiation model, we examined effects of AhR activation by indoxyl 3-sulfate (I3S), a uremic toxin, on Th17 differentiation and investigated underlying mechanisms. I3S increased expression of RORγt, the master transcription factor for Th17 differentiation, and stimulated Th17 differentiation, in a comparative manner as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a prototypical AhR ligand. Activation of STAT3, which is phosphorylated by the IL-6 signaling pathways and thus is necessary for Th17 differentiation, was strongly stimulated by I3S and TCDD. Phosphorylation of c-Src, which was shown to be activated by AhR ligands, was also increased by I3S and TCDD, and blocking of c-Src activity by 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) inhibited phosphorylation of both c-Src and STAT3, raising a possibility that stimulatory activities of I3S and TCDD on Th17 differentiation could be exerted via increased phosphorylation of c-Src, which in turn stimulates STAT3 activation. Finally, we found that I3S worsened experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is primarily mediated by Th17 cells, enhancing the frequency of IL-17-producing cells in draining lymph nodes.
12569076	Desensitization of beta2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses by short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists in human lung mast cells.	1 The principal aim of the present study was to determine whether long-term treatment of human lung mast cells (HLMC) with the clinically-relevant beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, salbutamol and terbutaline, leads to desensitization of beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in these cells. 2 The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, and the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, salbutamol and terbutaline, inhibited the IgE-mediated release of histamine from HLMC. Salbutamol (pD(2); 7.7+/-0.3) and terbutaline (pD(2); 7.3+/-0.2) were roughly equipotent as inhibitors of histamine release although both agonists were less potent than isoprenaline (pD(2); 8.6+/-0.2). 3 Isoprenaline (10(-5) M), salbutamol (10(-5) M) and terbutaline (10(-5) M) enhanced total cell cAMP levels in HLMC over basal by 361+/-90, 150+/-38 and 165+/-35%, respectively. 4 Long-term exposure (24 h) of HLMC to either salbutamol (10(-7) M) or terbutaline (10(-7) M) led to a subsequent reduction in the effectiveness of salbutamol and terbutaline (both 10(-9)-10(-4) M) to inhibit histamine release. However, salbutamol was significantly (P<0.05) more effective than terbutaline at promoting the functional desensitization. 5 Radioligand binding studies, using iodinated cyanopindolol, were performed to determine beta(2)-adrenoceptor density in cell membranes after pretreatment (24 h) of cells with either salbutamol (10(-6) M) or terbutaline (10(-6) M). Both agonists reduced beta(2)-adrenoceptor density in membranes to about the same extent (approximately 25% reduction) but these changes in receptor density were not statistically significant (P>0.05). 6 These data indicate that long-term exposure of mast cells to salbutamol causes greater levels of desensitization to beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in HLMC than terbutaline. These findings may have wider clinical significance in the context of asthma treatment as compromised mast cell inhibition could result following long-term exposure of mast cells to short-acting bronchodilators.
16495723	Effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors on cocaine discrimination in rats.	This study tested the time course of the discriminative stimulus effects of inhibitors of monoamine oxidase alone or in combination with cocaine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate cocaine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) from saline using a two-lever choice methodology. The nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors tranylcypromine (0.01-5 mg/kg) and phenelzine (1-25 mg/kg), the monoamine oxidase-A selective compound clorgyline (1-25 mg/kg), and the monoamine oxidase-B selective compounds pargyline (0.005-50 mg/kg) and selegiline (1-25 mg/kg) were tested for substitution 15 min or 24 h following administration, and in combination with 10 mg/kg of cocaine 24 and 48 h after administration. At 15 min, selegiline fully substituted for the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine, whereas all other compounds partially substituted. At 24 h, substitution of cocaine was diminished for all compounds except phenelzine, which produced a greater amount of substitution at 24 h than at 15 min. When cocaine was administered 24 h after clorgyline, selegiline, pargyline, and phenelzine, cocaine-appropriate responding was attenuated at intermediate doses of these drugs, whereas the highest doses did not alter cocaine-lever responding. All compounds except selegiline substantially decreased response rate and produced various adverse effects. At 48 h, the effects of all compounds except phenelzine were markedly reduced. Selectivity for monoamine oxidase-A or monoamine oxidase-B did not predict the ability to substitute for or attenuate the subjective effects of cocaine. These findings suggest that monoamine oxidase inhibitors can modulate the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine for at least 24 h, and may be useful for treatment of cocaine abuse.
23552260	Histological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies on the protective effect of ginger extract against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in male rats.	Cisplatin (CP) is a widely used anticancer drug; however, it has several side effects such as nephrotoxicity. Ginger, the rhizome of Zingiber officinale, consumed since ancient times has numerous health benefits. The objective of this work was to evaluate the protective effect of ginger extract (GE) against CP-induced nephrotoxicity. CP group displayed a marked renal failure characterized by a significant increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in addition to severe histopathological and ultrastructural renal alterations. Also, CP group showed an increase in the immunohistochemical expression of Bax proapoptotic protein. In contrast, GE+CP group showed significant decrease in the elevated serum creatinine and BUN levels and an improvement in the histopathological and ultrastructural renal injury induced by CP. The overexpression of Bax proapoptotic protein was significantly decreased in the GE+CP group. Hence, the present results indicated that GE has a protective effect against CP-induced renal damage in rats. Thereby, such findings recommended the usage of GE to prevent and/or decrease the renal damage induced by CP chemotherapeutic treatment.
11342438	Model for a factor IX activation complex on blood platelets: dimeric conformation of factor XIa is essential.	Human coagulation factor XI (FXI) is a plasma serine protease composed of 2 identical 80-kd polypeptides connected by a disulfide bond. This dimeric structure is unique among blood coagulation enzymes. The hypothesis was tested that dimeric conformation is required for normal FXI function by generating a monomeric version of FXI (FXI/PKA4) and comparing it to wild-type FXI in assays requiring factor IX activation by activated FXI (FXIa). FXI/PKA4 was made by replacing the FXI A4 domain with the A4 domain from prekallikrein (PK). A dimeric version of FXI/PKA4 (FXI/PKA4-Gly326) was prepared as a control. Activated FXI/PKA4 and FXI/PKA4-Gly326 activate factor IX with kinetic parameters similar to those of FXIa. In kaolin-triggered plasma clotting assays containing purified phospholipid, FXI/PKA4 and FXI/PKA4-Gly326 have coagulant activity similar to FXI. The surface of activated platelets is likely to be a physiologic site for reactions involving FXI/FXIa. In competition binding assays FXI/PKA4, FXI/PKA4-Gly326, and FXI have similar affinities for activated platelets (K(i) = 12-16 nM). In clotting assays in which phospholipid is replaced by activated platelets, the dimeric proteins FXI and FXI/PKA4-Gly326 promote coagulation similarly; however, monomeric FXI/PKA4 has greatly reduced activity. Western immunoblot analysis confirmed that activated monomeric FXI/PKA4 activates factor IX poorly in the presence of activated platelets. These findings demonstrate the importance of the dimeric state to FXI activity and suggest a novel model for factor IX activation in which FXIa binds to activated platelets by one chain of the dimer, while binding to factor IX through the other.
15871445	Tolerability of selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, celecoxib, in patients with analgesic intolerance.	Intolerance reactions to acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are common and caused by inhibition of COX-1 enzyme. Therefore, drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 enzyme may be safe in these subjects. In this study, we evaluated the tolerability of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in patients with analgesic intolerance. The eligible study population consisted of patients with a history of urticaria/angioedema, naso-ocular symptoms, bronchospasm, and/or anaphylactoid reaction induced by ASA and/or NSAIDs. A single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge test was performed in the hospital setting. On 2 separate days, 1/4 and 3/4 divided doses of placebo and celecoxib (Celebrex 200 mg, Pfizer, Turkey) were given with 2-hour intervals. Seventy-five subjects (mean age: 38.2 +/- 1.4 years; F:M: 55:20) were included in the study. Twenty-one subjects had asthma. No reaction was observed with placebo or celecoxib provocation. Although celecoxib seems to be a safe alternative drug in our study group, considering its serious adverse events reported in the literature, the drug should be recommended for patients with analgesic intolerance only after being tested by an experienced allergist.
23536271	β-Ionone arrests cell cycle of gastric carcinoma cancer cells by a MAPK pathway.	β-Ionone is an end ring analog of β-carotenoid which has been shown to possess potent anti-proliferative activity both in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the possible inhibitory effects of β-ionone, we studied cell growth characteristics, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways in the human gastric adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (SGC-7901). Our results show that cell growth and DNA synthesis were inhibited, and the cell cycle was arrested at the G0/G1 phase in a dose-dependent manner in cells treated with β-ionone (25, 50, 100 and 200 μmol/L) for 24 h. We found that the β-ionone significantly decreased the extracellular signal-regulated kinase protein expression and significantly increased the levels of p38 and Jun-amino-terminal kinase protein expression (P < 0.01). β-Ionone also inhibited cell cycle-related proteins of Cdk4, Cyclin B1, D1 and increased p27 protein expression in SGC-7901 cells. These results suggested that the cell cycle arrest observed may be regulated through a MAPK pathway by transcriptional down-regulation of cell cycle proteins. These results demonstrate potent ability of β-ionone to arrest cell cycle of SGC-7901 cells and decrease proliferation.
23510510	Dendrimer Driven Self-Assembly of SPR Active Silver-Gold Nanohybrids.	A fourth generation PAMAM dendrimer has been successfully employed for the development of a single step synthesis strategy for self-assembled Ag-Au nanohybrid structures. The surface plasmon resonance properties and the degree of self-assembly of the nanohybrid are strongly correlated with the stoichiometry of the metals which gives rise to enhanced plasmonic properties. The enhanced plasmonic response of the nanohybrids is modeled and is validated experimentally in a model HRP (horseradish peroxidise) bioassay carried out on an SPR-based biochip platform.
23192339	Transcriptional regulatory factor X6 (Rfx6) increases gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) expression in enteroendocrine K-cells and is involved in GIP hypersecretion in high fat diet-induced obesity.	Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is an incretin released from enteroendocrine K-cells in response to nutrient ingestion. GIP potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and induces energy accumulation into adipose tissue, resulting in obesity. Plasma GIP levels are reported to be increased in the obese state. However, the molecular mechanisms of GIP secretion and high fat diet (HFD)-induced GIP hypersecretion remain unclear, primarily due to difficulties in separating K-cells from other intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. In this study, GIP-GFP knock-in mice that enable us to visualize K-cells by enhanced GFP were established. Microarray analysis of isolated K-cells from these mice revealed that transcriptional regulatory factor X6 (Rfx6) is expressed exclusively in K-cells. In vitro experiments using the mouse intestinal cell line STC-1 showed that knockdown of Rfx6 decreased mRNA expression, cellular content, and secretion of GIP. Rfx6 bound to the region in the gip promoter that regulates gip promoter activity, and overexpression of Rfx6 increased GIP mRNA expression. HFD induced obesity and GIP hypersecretion in GIP-GFP heterozygous mice in vivo. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analysis showed no significant difference in K-cell number between control fat diet-fed (CFD) and HFD-fed mice. However, GIP content in the upper small intestine and GIP mRNA expression in K-cells were significantly increased in HFD-fed mice compared with those in CFD-fed mice. Furthermore, expression levels of Rfx6 mRNA were increased in K-cells of HFD-fed mice. These results suggest that Rfx6 increases GIP expression and content in K-cells and is involved in GIP hypersecretion in HFD-induced obesity.
10363282	Role of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) secreted by parasitic nematodes on the growth of the cell line from epithelial origin HT29-D4.	The excretory-secretory (E-S) products of the parasitic nematodes Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Nematodirus battus were found to modify the in vitro proliferation of the tumorous colic HT29-D4 cell line of epithelial origin. A characteristic feature of these E-S products is the presence of a high level of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, the biological significance of which remains unclear. To determine a possible role of AChE on cell growth, the enzyme was purified from E-S products using edrophonium chloride. Purity was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using silver and Karnovsky stains, before assessing its effects on cell proliferation. The purified AChE was incorporated at different concentrations in a culture medium of HT29-D4 cells. A mitogenic effect was shown for low concentrations (0.1-14 units). By contrast, an inhibitory effect was noted at high concentrations (35-1400 units). Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies were prepared and depletion of AChE in E-S products by immunoprecipitation or affinity chromatography resulted in a partial or total disappearance of the stimulatory effect of cell growth. Thus, the results form this in vitro study suggest a modulatory role for AChE secreted by nematode parasites on the proliferation of epithelial cells of the host.
23353821	Cystathionase mediates senescence evasion in melanocytes and melanoma cells.	The development of malignant melanoma is a highly complex process, which is still poorly understood. A majority of human melanomas are found to express a few oncogenic proteins, such as mutant RAS and BRAF variants. However, these oncogenes are also found in nevi, and it is now a well-accepted fact that their expression alone leads to senescence. This renders the understanding of senescence escape mechanisms an important point to understand tumor development. Here, we approached the question of senescence evasion by expressing the transcription factor v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-MYC), which is known to act synergistically with many oncogenes, in melanocytes. We observed that MYC drives the evasion of reactive-oxygen stress-induced melanocyte senescence, caused by activated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Conversely, MIZ1, the growth suppressing interaction partner of MYC, is involved in mediating melanocyte senescence. Both, MYC overexpression and Miz1 knockdown led to a strong reduction of endogenous reactive-oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and senescence. We identified the cystathionase (CTH) gene product as mediator of the ROS-related MYC and MIZ1 effects. Blocking CTH enzymatic activity in MYC-overexpressing and Miz1 knockdown cells increased intracellular stress and senescence. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of CTH in human melanoma cells also reconstituted senescence in the majority of cell lines, and CTH knockdown reduced tumorigenic effects such as proliferation, H(2)O(2) resistance and soft agar growth. Thus, we identified CTH as new MYC target gene with an important function in senescence evasion.Oncogene advance online publication, 28 January 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.641.
12416991	Kinetics of allopregnanolone formation catalyzed by human 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type III (AKR1C2).	Allopregnanolone is a neurosteroid which exhibits anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activities through potentiation of the GABA(A) receptor. The reduction of 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone (5alpha-DHP), the last step in allopregnanolone biosynthesis, is catalyzed by 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3alpha-HSDs). While the mechanism of action of allopregnanolone and the physiological and pharmacological modulation of allopregnanolone concentrations in vivo have been extensively studied, there has been little characterization of the kinetics of human 3alpha-HSD catalyzed allopregnanolone formation. We report here determination of the kinetic mechanism for 5alpha-DHP reduction catalyzed by human 3alpha-HSD type III by using steady-state kinetics studies and assessment of the ability of fluoxetine and various other small molecules to activate 3alpha-HSD type III catalyzed allopregnanolone formation. Enzyme-catalyzed 5alpha-DHP reduction yielded two products, allopregnanolone and 5alpha,20alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone, as measured by using a radiometric thin-layer chromatography assay, while 5beta-DHP reduction yielded the neurosteroid pregnanolone as the only product. 5Beta-DHP reduction proceeded with a catalytic efficiency 10 times higher than that of 5alpha-DHP reduction. Two-substrate kinetic analysis and dead-end inhibition studies for 5alpha-DHP reduction and allopregnanolone oxidation indicated that 3alpha-HSD type III utilized a ternary complex (sequential) kinetic mechanism, with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor binding before steroid substrate and leaving after steroid product. Since previous reports suggested that fluoxetine and certain other small molecules increased allopregnanolone concentrations in vivo by activating 3alpha-HSD type III, we investigated whether these small molecules were able to activate human 3alpha-HSD type III. Our results showed that, at concentrations up to 50 microM, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, carbamazepine, clozapine, flurbiprofen, and sulfobromophthalein did not activate the enzyme. These results characterize the role of 3alpha-HSD type III in allopregnanolone formation and suggest that activation of this enzyme by fluoxetine is likely not the mechanism by which fluoxetine increases allopregnanolone concentrations.
9587031	Remethylation defects: guidelines for clinical diagnosis and treatment.	The main remethylation defects include disorders which all have defective methionine synthesis in common. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency impairs methyltetrahydrofolate synthesis, defects in cytosolic reduction of hydroxocobalamin (CblC/D) impair the synthesis of both methyl- and adenosyl cobalamin and deficiencies of methionine synthase (CblE/G) are associated with defective methyl cobalamin synthesis. The clinical presentation is characterized by acute neurological distress in early infancy. In childhood, patients present with progressive encephalopathy with an end-stage which has many signs in common with the adult onset form. In fact, both have more or less severe signs of subacute degeneration of the cord. Cobalamin defective patients must be treated with parenteral supplementation of hydroxocobalamin (1-2 mg per dose). Some methylenetetrahydrofolate patients could be folate responsive and must have a high-dosage folate trial. In addition, oral betaine supplementation (2-9 g per day depending on age) appears an effective means to prevent further neurological deterioration.
16325050	The Arg389Gly beta1-adrenoceptor polymorphism and catecholamine effects on plasma-renin activity.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to find out whether, in humans, dobutamine-induced hemodynamic effects and increase in plasma-renin activity (PRA) might be beta1-adrenoceptor (beta1AR) genotype-dependent. BACKGROUND: In vitro Arg389Gly-beta1AR polymorphism exhibits decreased receptor signaling. METHODS: We studied 10 male homozygous Arg389-beta1AR subjects and 8 male homozygous Gly389beta1AR subjects; to avoid influences of codon 49 polymorphism, all were homozygous Ser49-beta1AR. Subjects were infused with dobutamine (1 to 6 microg/kg/min) with or without bisoprolol (10 mg orally) pretreatment, and PRA, heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure were assessed. RESULTS: With regard to PRA, dobutamine increased PRA more potently in Arg389-beta1AR versus Gly389-beta1AR subjects. Bisoprolol markedly suppressed the dobutamine-induced PRA increase in Arg389- but only marginally in Gly389-beta1AR subjects. With regard to hemodynamics, dobutamine caused larger heart rate and contractility increases and diastolic blood pressure decreases in Arg389- versus Gly389-beta1AR subjects. Bisoprolol reduced dobutamine-induced heart rate and contractility increases and diastolic blood pressure decreases more potently in Arg389- versus Gly389-beta1AR subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Codon 389 beta1AR polymorphism is a determinant not only of hemodynamic effects but also of PRA. Thus, beta1AR polymorphisms may be useful for predicting therapeutic responses to betaAR-blocker treatment.
23335106	Fast, reversible, and general photomechanical motion in single crystals of various azo compounds using visible light.	Pseudostilbene-type single crystals exhibit ubiquitous, fast, and reversible photomechanical motion under visible-light irradiation. Push-pull substituents impart extremely rapid switching using just one wavelength of light by shortening the lifetime of the cis-form. This results in a bending motion in the microsecond regime. The influence of crystal density, thickness, and molecular orientation on optimization of the photomechanical effect is investigated.
23001627	Levothyroxine replacement therapy with vitamin E supplementation prevents oxidative stress and cognitive deficit in experimental hypothyroidism.	Hypothyroidism has a variety of adverse effects on cognitive function. The treatment of levothyroxine alone cannot restore cognitive defects of hypothyroid patients. Antioxidant vitamin E supplementation could be useful in disturbances which are associated with oxidative stress and could effectively slow the progression of Alzheimer disease. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative stress status of the serum and hippocampus in hypothyroidism and to examine the effects of levothyroxine replacement therapy with vitamin E supplementation on cognitive deficit. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: control group, PTU group, PTU + Vit E group, PTU + L-T4 group, and PTU + L-T4 + Vit E group. Serum and hippocampus malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined using the thiobarbituric-acid reactive substances method. Serum and hippocampus superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were determined by measuring its ability to inhibit the photoreduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. Learning and memory was assessed by Morris water maze test. In the present study, we found that the rats of PTU + Vit E group spent less time to find the platform on days 2, 3, 4, and 5 than the PTU group. Moreover, the rats of PTU + L-T4 + Vit E group spent less time to find the platform on days 4 and 5 than the PTU + L-T4 group. The time spent in the target quadrants was measured in the probe test and no difference was observed in all groups. Oxidative damage has been observed in the serum and hippocampus of hypothyroidism rat. SOD levels of serum and hippocampus tissue were significantly increased and MDA levels were significantly decreased in the PTU + Vit E and PTU + L-T4 + Vit E groups than the PTU and PTU + L-T4 groups. Therefore, these findings indicate that levothyroxine replacement therapy with vitamin E supplementation may ameliorate cognitive deficit in PTU-induced hypothyroidism through the decrease of oxidative stress status.
23380477	Autophagy takes place in mutated p53 neuroblastoma cells in response to hypoxia mimetic CoCl(2).	Solid tumors like neuroblastoma exhibit hypoxic areas, which can lead both to cell death or aggressiveness increase. Hypoxia is a known stress able to induce stabilization of p53, implicated in cell fate regulation. Recently, p53 appeared to be involved in autophagy in an opposite manner, depending on its location: when nuclear, it enhanced transcription of pro-autophagic genes whereas when cytoplasmic, it inhibited the autophagic process. Today, we used cobalt chloride, a hypoxia mimetic that inhibits proteasomal HIF-1 degradation and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). We focused on CoCl2-induced cell death in a DNA-binding mutated p53 neuroblastoma cell line (SKNBE(2c)). An autophagic signaling was evidenced by an increase of Beclin-1, ATG 5-12, and LC3-II expression whereas the p53(mut) presence decreased with CoCl2 time exposure. Activation of the pathway seemed to protect cells from ROS production and, at least in part, from death. The autophagic inhibitors activated the apoptotic signaling and the death was enhanced. To delineate the eventual implication of the p53(mut) in the autophagic process in response to hypoxia, we monitored signaling in p53(WT)SHSY5Y cells, after either shRNA-p53 down-regulation or transcriptional activity inhibition by pifithrin alpha. We did not detect autophagy neither with p53(wt) nor when p53 was lacking whereas such a response was effective with a mutated or inactivated p53. To conclude, mutated p53 in neuroblastoma cells could be linked with the switch between apoptotic response and cell death by autophagy in response to hypoxic mimetic stress.
20573261	Histamine H4 receptor antagonism diminishes existing airway inflammation and dysfunction via modulation of Th2 cytokines.	BACKGROUND: Airway remodeling and dysfunction are characteristic features of asthma thought to be caused by aberrant production of Th2 cytokines. Histamine H4 receptor (H4R) perturbation has previously been shown to modify acute inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in a murine model of asthma. We examined the ability of H4R antagonists to therapeutically modify the effects of Th2 cytokine production such as goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH), and collagen deposition in a sub-chronic model of asthma. In addition, effects on Th2 mediated lung dysfunction were also determined. METHODS: Mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) followed by repeated airway challenge with OVA. After inflammation was established mice were dosed with the H4R antagonist, JNJ 7777120, or anti-IL-13 antibody for comparison. Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was measured, lungs lavaged and tissues collected for analysis. RESULTS: Therapeutic H4R antagonism inhibited T cell infiltration in to the lung and decreased Th2 cytokines IL-13 and IL-5. IL-13 dependent remodeling parameters such as GCH and lung collagen were reduced. Intervention with H4R antagonist also improved measures of central and peripheral airway dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that therapeutic H4R antagonism can significantly ameliorate allergen induced, Th2 cytokine driven pathologies such as lung remodeling and airway dysfunction. The ability of H4R antagonists to affect these key manifestations of asthma suggests their potential as novel human therapeutics.
23293094	Dietary exposure of mink (Mustela vison) to fish from the upper Hudson River, New York, USA: effects on reproduction and offspring growth and mortality.	The effects of feeding farm-raised mink (Mustela vison) diets containing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated fish from the upper Hudson River (New York, USA) on adult reproductive performance and kit growth and mortality were evaluated. Diets contained 2.5 to 20% Hudson River fish, providing 0.72 to 6.1 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (4.8-38 pg toxic equivalents [TEQWHO 2005 ]/g feed). The percentage of stillborn kits per litter was significantly increased by dietary concentrations of 4.5 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (28 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g feed) and greater. All offspring exposed to dietary concentrations of 4.5 and 6.1 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (28 and 38 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g feed) died by 10 weeks of age, and all offspring exposed to 1.5 and 2.8 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (10 and 18 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g feed) died by 31 weeks of age, leaving juveniles in the control and 0.72 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (0.41- and 4.8 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g feed) groups only. The dietary concentration predicted to result in 20% kit mortality (LC20) at six weeks of age was 0.34 µg ∑PCBs/g feed (2.6 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g feed). The corresponding maternal hepatic concentration was 0.80 µg ∑PCBs/g liver, wet weight (13 pg TEQWHO 2005 /g liver, wet wt). Mink residing in the upper Hudson River would be expected to consume species of fish that contain an average of 4.0 µg ∑PCBs/g tissue. Thus, a daily diet composed of less than 10% Hudson River fish could provide a dietary concentration of ∑PCBs that resulted in 20% kit mortality in the present study.
23556445	Genomic variation in the MAP3K5 gene is associated with β-thalassemia disease severity and hydroxyurea treatment efficacy.	Aim: In this study we explored the association between genetic variations in MAP3K5 and PDE7B genes, residing on chromosome 6q23, and disease severity in β-hemoglobinopathy patients, as well as the association between these variants with response to hydroxyurea (HU) treatment. Furthermore, we examined MAP3K5 expression in the context of high fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and upon HU treatment in erythroid progenitor cells from healthy and KLF1 haploinsufficient individuals. Materials & methods: For this purpose, we genotyped β-thalassemia intermedia and major patients and healthy controls, as well as a cohort of compound heterozygous sickle cell disease/β-thalassemia patients receiving HU as HbF augmentation treatment. Furthermore, we examined MAP3K5 expression in the context of high HbF and upon HU treatment in erythroid progenitor cells from healthy and KLF1 haploinsufficient individuals. Results: A short tandem repeat in the MAP3K5 promoter and two intronic MAP3K5 gene variants, as well as a PDE7B variant, are associated with low HbF levels and a severe disease phenotype. Moreover, MAP3K5 mRNA expression levels are altered in the context of high HbF and are affected by the presence of HU. Lastly, the abovementioned MAP3K5 variants are associated with HU treatment efficacy. Conclusion: Our data suggest that these MAP3K5 variants are indicative of β-thalassemia disease severity and response to HU treatment.

23618899	Expression of WWOX and FHIT is downregulated by exposure to arsenite in human uroepithelial cells.	Ecological studies in Taiwan, Chile, Argentina, Bangladesh, and Mexico have confirmed significant dose-dependent associations between ingestion of arsenic-contaminated drinking water and the risk of various human malignancies. The FHIT and WWOX genes are active in common fragile sites FRA3B and FRA16D, respectively. Reduced expression of FHIT or WWOX is known to be an early indicator of carcinogen-induced cancers. However, the effect of arsenite on the expressions and molecular mechanisms of these markers is still unclear. The aims of this study were (i) to observe the expression of ATR, WWOX and FHIT proteins in urothelial carcinoma (UC) between endemic and non-endemic areas of blackfoot disease (BFD) by immunohistochemical analyses; (ii) to compare expression of these genes between arsenite-treated SV-HUC-1 human epithelial cells and rat uroepithelial cells; and (iii) to determine the role of DNMT and MEK inhibitors on expressions of WWOX and FHIT in response to arsenite in SV-HUC-1. The experiments revealed that expressions of ATR, WWOX and FHIT in UC significantly differed between BFD areas and non-BFD areas (p=0.003, 0.009 and 0.021, respectively). In fact, the results for the arsenite-treated groups showed that ATR, WWOX and FHIT are downregulated by arsenite in SV-HUC-1. However, the inhibitors suppressed the effects of arsenite on WWOX and FHIT proteins and mRNA expression. In conclusion, arsenite decreased expressions of ATR, WWOX and FHIT via ERK1/2 activation in SV-HUC-1 cells. These findings confirm that dysregulations of these markers may contribute to arsenite-induced carcinogenesis.
7995016	Pharmacokinetic aspects of l-deprenyl (selegiline) and its metabolites.	l-Deprenyl (selegiline), an irreversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B), is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed into tissues. The reaction between MAO and selegiline takes place in two steps. The initial reversible reaction is followed by an irreversible reaction in which selegiline is bound covalently to the flavin part of the enzyme. Studies with positron emission tomography have shown retention of selegiline in brain areas with high MAO-B activity, including striatal structures, hippocampus, thalamus, and substantia nigra. Inhibition of MAO-B in vivo takes place rapidly; for example, platelet MAO is inhibited almost totally within the first 60 minutes after a single 10 mg oral dose of the drug. The recovery of MAO after inhibition depends on the organ and species in question. In rat brain the half-life of recovery in the brain is approximately 8 to 12 days; in rat liver it is shorter, 1 to 3 days. Selegiline is metabolized into l-(-)-desmethylselegiline, l-(-)-methamphetamine, and l-(-)-amphetamine mainly in the liver through the microsomal P-450 system. The stereoselectivity of the metabolites is maintained; no racemic transformation takes place. All three main metabolites are found in human serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine, and l-(-)-methamphetamine accounts for most of the metabolite pool. The metabolites are excreted mainly via urine l-(-)-Desmethylselegiline has been shown to be an irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B in the rat and in humans.
3320565	Pharmacological and clinical studies of the antiandrogen Anandron.	This paper summarizes the animal and human studies with Anandron available at the time of the meeting. The following was demonstrated in the rat and confirmed in man: interaction of Anandron with the prostatic androgen receptor, antiandrogen activity against testosterone (in particular against the early transient rise induced by LHRH analogs) and adrenal androgens. Thus, as shown in 4 different double blind studies performed in stage D2 prostrate cancer patients, the combination of Anandron with surgical or chemical castration enhanced the beneficial effects of castration alone and thus seems a step forward in the hormonal treatment of prostatic carcinoma.
9374794	Blockage of the HERG human cardiac K+ channel by the gastrointestinal prokinetic agent cisapride.	Cisapride, a gastrointestinal prokinetic agent, is known to cause long Q-T syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. The cellular mechanism is not known. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG), which encodes the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current and is important in cardiac repolarization, may serve as a target for the action of cisapride. We tested the hypothesis that cisapride blocks HERG. The whole cell patch-clamp recording technique was used to study HERG channels stably expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells. Under voltage-clamp conditions, cisapride block of HERG is dose dependent with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 6.5 nM at 22 degrees C (n = 25 cells). Currents rapidly recovered with drug washout. The onset of block by cisapride required channel activation indicative of open or inactivated state blockage. Block of HERG with cisapride after channel activation was voltage dependent. At -20 mV, 10 nM cisapride reduced HERG tail-current amplitude by 5%, whereas, at + 20 mV, the tail-current amplitude was reduced by 45% (n = 4 cells). At -20 and + 20 mV, 100 nM cisapride reduced tail-current amplitude by 66 and 90%, respectively. We conclude that cisapride is a potent blocker of HERG channels expressed in HEK293 cells. This effect may account for the clinical occurrence of Q-T prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias observed with cisapride.
23334943	High-grade prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy among men using 5α-reductase inhibitors and alpha-blockers.	BACKGROUND: Two clinical trials have shown that users of 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride (5-ARIs) have reduced overall prostate cancer risk, while the proportion of high-grade tumors is increased. We studied tumor characteristics, risk of biochemical recurrence and mortality after radical prostatectomy in 5-ARI and alpha-blocker users. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 1,315 men who underwent radical prostatectomy at the Tampere University Hospital during 1995-2009. Biochemical relapse was defined as serum PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml after the operation. Information on mortality and medication purchases was obtained from national registries. Cox proportional regression was used to analyze hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of biochemical relapse and death. RESULTS: The proportion of high-grade (Gleason 7-10) tumors was significantly elevated among men who had used 5-ARIs for 4 years or longer compared to the non-users (83.3% vs. 53.3%, respectively). Survival curves for biochemical relapse-free survival differed between long-term and short-term 5-ARI users, but the hazard ratio remained statistically non-significant. Risk of biochemical recurrence was elevated among alpha-blocker users (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.37-2.06), but in sensitivity analyses this was evident only in men using alpha-blockers after prostatectomy. Mortality was not associated with medication usage. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term users of finasteride or dutasteride had more often high-grade prostate cancer. Our results suggest also worse progression-free survival. The association between risk of biochemical recurrence and post-operative alpha-blocker usage suggests that voiding or storage symptoms after prostatectomy may predict biochemical relapse.

23292752	New oral anticoagulants: comparative pharmacology with vitamin K antagonists.	New oral anticoagulants (OACs) that directly inhibit Factor Xa (FXa) or thrombin have been developed for the long-term prevention of thromboembolic disorders. These novel agents provide numerous benefits over older vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) due to major pharmacological differences. VKAs are economical and very well characterized, but have important limitations that can outweigh these advantages, such as slow onset of action, narrow therapeutic window and unpredictable anticoagulant effect. VKA-associated dietary precautions, monitoring and dosing adjustments to maintain international normalized ratio (INR) within therapeutic range, and bridging therapy, are inconvenient for patients, expensive, and may result in inappropriate use of VKA therapy. This may lead to increased bleeding risk or reduced anticoagulation and increased risk of thrombotic events. The new OACs have rapid onset of action, low potential for food and drug interactions, and predictable anticoagulant effect that removes the need for routine monitoring. FXa inhibitors, e.g. rivaroxaban and apixaban, are potent, oral direct inhibitors of prothrombinase-bound, clot-associated or free FXa. Both agents have a rapid onset of action, a wide therapeutic window, little or no interaction with food and other drugs, minimal inter-patient variability, and display similar pharmacokinetics in different patient populations. Since both are substrates, co-administration of rivaroxaban and apixaban with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors and inducers can result in substantial changes in plasma concentrations due to altered clearance rates; consequently, their concomitant use is contraindicated and caution is required when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers. Although parenteral oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs), such as argatroban and bivalirudin, have been on the market for years, DTIs such as dabigatran are novel synthetic thrombin antagonists. Dabigatran etexilate is a low-molecular-weight non-active pro-drug that is administered orally and converted rapidly to its active form, dabigatran--a potent, competitive and reversible DTI. Dabigatran has an advantage over the indirect thrombin inhibitors, unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, in that it inhibits free and fibrin-bound thrombin. The reversible binding of dabigatran may provide safer and more predictable anticoagulant treatment than seen with irreversible, non-covalent thrombin inhibitors, e.g. hirudin. Dabigatran shows a very low potential for drug-drug interactions. However, co-administration of dabigatran etexilate with other anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents can increase the bleeding risk. Although the new agents are pharmacologically better than VKAs--particularly in terms of fixed dosing, rapid onset of action, no INR monitoring and lower risk of drug interactions--there are some differences between them: the bioavailability of dabigatran is lower than rivaroxaban and apixaban, and so the dabigatran dosage required is higher; lower protein binding of dabigatran reduces the variability related to albuminaemia. The risk of metabolic drug-drug interactions also appears to differ between OACs: VKAs > rivaroxaban > apixaban > dabigatran. The convenience of the new OACs has translated into improvements in efficacy and safety as shown in phase III randomized trials. The new anticoagulants so far offer the greatest promise and opportunity for the replacement of VKAs.
23044992	Deletion of CD74, a putative MIF receptor, in mice enhances osteoclastogenesis and decreases bone mass.	CD74 is a type II transmembrane protein that can act as a receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and plays a role in MIF-regulated responses. We reported that MIF inhibited osteoclast formation and MIF knockout (KO) mice had decreased bone mass. We therefore examined if CD74 was involved in the ability of MIF to alter osteoclastogenesis in cultured bone marrow (BM) from wild-type (WT) and CD74-deficient (KO) male mice. We also measured the bone phenotype of CD74 KO male mice. Bone mass in the femur of 8-week-old mice was measured by micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry. Bone marrow cells from CD74 KO mice formed 15% more osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) (both at 30 ng/mL) compared to WT. Addition of MIF to WT cultures inhibited OCL formation by 16% but had no effect on CD74KO cultures. The number of colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) in the bone marrow of CD74 KO mice was 26% greater than in WT controls. Trabecular bone volume (TBV) in the femurs of CD74 KO male mice was decreased by 26% compared to WT. In addition, cortical area and thickness were decreased by 14% and 11%, respectively. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)(+) osteoclast number and area were significantly increased in CD74 KO by 35% and 43%, respectively compared to WT. Finally, we examined the effect of MIF on RANKL-induced-signaling pathways in bone marrow macrophage (BMM) cultures. MIF treatment decreased RANKL-induced nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) and c-Fos protein in BMM cultures by 70% and 41%, respectively. Our data demonstrate that CD74 is required for MIF to affect in vitro osteoclastogenesis. Further, the bone phenotype of CD74 KO mice is similar to that of MIF KO mice. MIF treatment of WT cultures suppressed RANKL-induced activator protein 1 (AP-1) expression, which resulted in decreased osteoclast differentiation in vitro. We propose that CD74 plays a critical role in the MIF inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.
23549331	A Distal Enhancer Controls Cytokine-dependent Human cPLA2α Gene Expression.	Specific control of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α or PLA2G4A) expression modulates arachidonic acid production, thus tightly regulating the downstream effects of pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. The significance of this pathway in human disease is apparent in a range of pathologies from inflammation to tumorigenesis. While much of the regulation of cPLA2α has focused on post-translational phosphorylation of the protein, studies on transcriptional regulation of this gene have focused only on proximal promoter regions. We have identified a DNase I hypersensitive site encompassing a 5' distal enhancer element containing a highly conserved consensus AP-1 site involved in transcriptional activation of cPLA2α by IL-1β. ChIP, knockdown, knockout and overexpression analyses have shown that c-Jun acts both in a negative and positive regulatory role. Transcriptional activation of cPLA2α occurs through the phosphorylation of c-Jun in conjunction with increased association of C/EBPβ with the distal novel enhancer. The association of C/EBPβ with the transcriptional activation complex does not require an obvious DNA binding site. These data provide new and important contributions to the understanding of cPLA2α regulation at the transcriptional level with implications to eicosanoid metabolism, cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis.
7625729	Drospirenone: a novel progestogen with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity.	Drospirenone (ZK 30595; 6 beta, 7 beta, 15 beta, 16 beta-dimethylen-3-oxo-17 alpha-pregn-4-ene-21, 17-carbolactone) is a novel progestogen under clinical development. Drospirenone is characterized by an innovative pharmacodynamic profile which is very closely related to that of progesterone. Potential applications include oral contraception, hormone replacement therapy and treatment of hormonal disorders. The pharmacological properties of drospirenone were investigated in vitro by receptor binding and transactivation experiments and in vivo in appropriate animal models. In qualitative agreement with progesterone, the compound binds strongly to the progesterone and the mineralocorticoid receptor and with lower affinity to androgen and glucocorticoid receptors. There is no detectable binding to the estrogen receptor. Steroid hormone agonistic and antagonistic activities of progesterone and drospirenone were compared in transactivation experiments. Individual steroid hormone receptors were artificially expressed together with a reporter gene in appropriate cell lines. Both hormones were unable to induce any androgen receptor-mediated agonistic activity. Rather, both progesterone and drospirenone distinctly antagonized androgen-stimulated transcriptional activation. Likewise, both compounds only very weakly activated the mineralocorticoid receptor but showed potent aldosterone antagonistic activity. Drospirenone did not induce glucocorticoid receptor-driven transactivation. Progesterone was a weak agonist in this respect. Drospirenone exerts potent progestogenic and antigonadotropic activity which was studied in various animal species. It efficiently promotes the maintenance of pregnancy in ovariectomized rats, inhibits ovulation in rats and mice and stimulates endometrial transformation in the rabbit. Furthermore, drospirenone shows potent antigonadotropic, i.e., testosterone-lowering activity in male cynomolgus monkeys. The progestogenic potency of drospirenone was found to be in the range of that of norethisterone acetate. The majority of clinically used progestogens are androgenic. Drospirenone, like progesterone, has no androgenic but rather an antiandrogenic effect. This property was demonstrated in castrated, testosterone propionate substituted male rats by a dose-dependent inhibition of accessory sex organ growth (seminal vesicles, prostate). In this model, the potency of drospirenone was about a third that of cyproterone acetate. Drospirenone, like progesterone, shows antimineralocorticoid activity, which causes moderately increased sodium and water excretion. This is an outstanding characteristic which has not been described for any other synthetic progestogen before. Drospirenone is eight to ten times more effective in this respect than spironolactone. The natriuretic effect was demonstrable for at least three weeks upon daily treatment of rats with a dose of 10 mg/animal. Drospirenone is devoid of any estrogenic, glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity. In summary, drospirenone, like progesterone, combines potent progestogenic with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity in a similar dose range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
23349485	Disruption of the cereblon gene enhances hepatic AMPK activity and prevents high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice.	A nonsense mutation in cereblon (CRBN) causes a mild type of mental retardation in humans. An earlier study showed that CRBN negatively regulates the functional activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro by binding directly to the α1 subunit of the AMPK complex. However, the in vivo role of CRBN was not studied. To elucidate the physiological functions of Crbn, a mouse strain was generated in which the Crbn gene was deleted throughout the whole body. In Crbn-deficient mice fed a normal diet, AMPK in the liver showed hyper-phosphorylation, which indicated the constitutive activation of AMPK. Since Crbn-deficient mice showed significantly less weight gain when fed a high fat diet and their insulin sensitivity was considerably improved, the functions of Crbn in the liver were primarily investigated. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that Crbn is a negative modulator of AMPK, which suggests that Crbn may be a potential target for metabolic disorders of the liver.
23363425	Silica precipitation by synthetic minicollagens.	Oligomeric Pro-Hyp-Gly- (POG-) peptides, wherein the collagenous triple helix is supported by C-terminal capping, exhibit silica precipitation properties (O, Hyp = (2S,4R)hydroxyproline). As quantified by a molybdate assay, the length of the covalently tethered triple helix (number of POG units) determines the amount of amorphous silica obtained from silicic acid solution. Although lacking charged side chains, the synthetic collagens precipitate large quantities of silicic acid resulting in micrometer-sized spheres of varying surface morphologies as analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Similar precipitation efficiencies on a fast time scale of less than 10 min were previously described only for biogenic diatom proteins and sponge collagen, respectively, which have a considerably higher structural complexity and limited accessibility. The minicollagens described here provide an unexpected alternative to the widely used precipitation conditions, which generally depend on (poly-)amines in phosphate buffer. Collagen can form intimate connections with inorganic matter. Hence, silica-enclosed collagens have promising perspectives as composite materials.
10430100	Antitumor activity of ZD1694 (tomudex) against human head and neck cancer in nude mouse models: role of dosing schedule and plasma thymidine.	We studied the antitumor activity and toxicity of ZD1694 (tomudex), a specific inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS), in nude mice bearing human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma A253 and FaDu xenografts. Mice were treated by single i.v. push (i.v. x 1), i.v. push once a week for 3 weeks (weekly x 3), and i.v. push once a day for 5 days (daily x 5), and the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of ZD1694 were 300 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg/week, and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. ZD1694 was moderately active against both A253 and FaDu xenografts. Antitumor activity was schedule-dependent in both tumors: weekly x 3 > or = i.v. x 1 >> daily x 5. In contrast, the rank order of toxicity was daily x 5 >> weekly x 3 > or = i.v. x 1. ZD1694 at the MTD produced 20% complete tumor regression and 20% partial tumor regression (PR) with i.v. x 1 and weekly x 3 schedules and 12-day tumor growth delay with daily x 5 schedule against FaDu xenografts. No complete tumor regression was achieved with ZD1694 with any schedule against A253; a 20% PR, 40% PR, and 10-day tumor growth delay were observed with i.v. x 1, weekly x 3, and daily x 5 schedules, respectively. The data indicate that ZD1694 was slightly more effective against FaDu than against A253. Of interest and potential clinical importance was the observation that ZD1694 was still active at doses lower than the MTD (> or =1/3 MTD), which showed a high therapeutic index and wide safety margin. Study of ZD1694 compared with 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine at the MTD revealed that the antitumor activity of ZD1694 was comparable with or superior to 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine against both A253 and FaDu xenografts, with less toxicity. High plasma thymidine in mouse relative to human (approximately 1.3 microM and <0.1 microM, respectively) may complicate the study of antitumor activity and toxicity of TS inhibitors with human tumor xenografts grown in the mouse. To test this hypothesis, we preadministered methoxypolyethyleneglycol-conjugated thymidine phosphorylase (MPEG-TPase; 2500 units/kg/dose) to reduce mouse plasma thymidine, then treated with various doses of ZD1694 using the daily x 5 or i.v. x 1 schedules in the A253 tumor model. MPEG-TPase significantly increased the toxicity of ZD1694; the MTD of ZD1694 plus MPEG-TPase was reduced 3- and 10-fold compared with ZD1694 alone for i.v x 1 and daily x 5 schedules, respectively. However, preadministration of MPEG-TPase did not potentiate the antitumor activity of ZD1694 with either schedule. The data indicate that the study of TS inhibitors in rodent models may not be suitable for predicting a safe dose for clinical study. However, rodent models, particularly human tumor xenografts, are still useful models for evaluation of antitumor activity and schedule selection for TS inhibitors.
23360412	Bioactivation of the nasal toxicant 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile: an assessment of metabolic activity in human nasal mucosa and identification of indicators of exposure and potential toxicity.	The herbicide 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (DCBN) is a potent nasal toxicant in rodents; however, it is not known whether DCBN causes similar nasal toxicity in humans. The tissue-selective toxicity of DCBN in mouse nasal mucosa is largely dependent on target tissue bioactivation by CYP2A5. The human orthologues of CYP2A5, CYP2A6 and CYP2A13, are both expressed in nasal mucosa and are capable of activating DCBN. In this study, we directly determined the ability of human nasal mucosa to bioactivate DCBN. We also tested the suitability of a glutathione conjugate of DCBN (GS-DCBN) or its derivatives as biomarkers of DCBN exposure and nasal toxicity in mouse models. We found that human fetal nasal mucosa microsomes catalyze the formation of GS-DCBN, with a Km value comparable to that of adult mouse nasal mucosa microsomes. The activity of the human nasal mucosa microsomes was inhibited by 8-methoxypsoralen, a known CYP2A inhibitor. GS-DCBN and its metabolites were detected in the nasal mucosa and nasal-wash fluid obtained from DCBN-treated mice, in amounts that increased with escalations in DCBN dose, and they were all still detectable at 24 h after a DCBN treatment (at 10 mg/kg). Further studies in Cyp2a5-null mice indicated that GS-DCBN and its metabolites in nasal-wash fluid were generated in the nasal mucosa, rather than in other organs. Thus, our data indicate for the first time that the human nasal mucosa is capable of bioactivating DCBN and that GS-DCBN and its metabolites in nasal-wash fluid may collectively serve as indicators of DCBN exposure and potential nasal toxicity in humans.
23569204	Structural and functional characterization of a phosphatase domain within yeast general transcription factor TFIIIC.	Saccharomyces cerevisiae τ55, a subunit of the RNA polymerase III-specific general transcription factor TFIIIC, comprises an N-terminal histidine phosphatase domain (τ55-HPD) whose catalytic activity and cellular function is poorly understood. We solved the crystal structures of τ55-HPD and its closely related paralogue Huf and used in silico docking methods to identify phospho-serine and phospho-tyrosine containing peptides as possible substrates that were subsequently validated using in vitro phosphatase assays. A comparative phospho-proteomic study identified additional phosphopeptides as possible targets, which show the involvement of these two phosphatases in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions. Our results identify τ55-HPD and Huf as bona fide protein phosphatases, characterize their substrate specificities and provide a small set of regulated phosphosite targets in vivo.
23470287	A newly synthesized sinapic Acid derivative inhibits endothelial activation in vitro and in vivo.	Inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) may represent a new therapeutic strategy against endothelial activation. Sinapic acid (SA), a phenylpropanoid compound, is found in natural herbs and high-bran cereals and has moderate antioxidant activity. We aimed to develop new SA agents with the properties of antioxidation and blocking EC activation for possible therapy of cardiovascular disease. We designed and synthesized 10 SA derivatives according to their chemical structures. Preliminary screening of the compounds involved scavenging hydroxyl radicals and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH(⋅)), croton oil-induced ear edema in mice, and analysis of the mRNA expression of adhesion molecules in ECs. 1-Acetyl-sinapic acyl-4-(3'-chlorine-)benzylpiperazine (SA9) had the strongest antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the effect of SA9 was further studied. SA9 inhibited tumor necrosis factor α-induced upregulation of adhesion molecules in ECs at both mRNA and protein levels, as well as the consequent monocyte adhesion to ECs. In vivo, result of face-to-face immunostaining showed that SA9 reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in mouse aortic intima. To study the molecular mechanism, results from luciferase assay, nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and Western blot indicated that the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effects of SA9 might be suppression of intracellular generation of ROS and inhibition of NF-κB activation in ECs. SA9 is a prototype of a novel class of antioxidant with anti-inflammatory effects in ECs. It may represent a new therapeutic approach for preventing endothelial activation in cardiovascular disorders.
17089011	DNA topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) inhibitors up-regulate fatty acid synthase gene expression in SK-Br3 breast cancer cells: in vitro evidence for a 'functional amplicon' involving FAS, Her-2/neu and TOP2A genes.	Fatty acid synthase (FAS), the key metabolic multi-enzyme that is responsible for the terminal catalytic step in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, plays an active role in the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the malignant phenotype in a subset of breast carcinomas. We recently described that a molecular bi-directional cross-talk between FAS and the Her-2/neu (erbB-2) oncogene is taking place at the level of transcription, translation, and activity in breast cancer cells. Because Her-2/neu has been linked with altered sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, we envisioned that FAS gene expression may represent a novel predictive molecular factor for breast cancer response to chemotherapy in a Her-2/neu-related manner. We herein evaluated whether chemotherapy-induced cell damage acts in an epigenetic fashion by inducing changes in the transcriptional activation of FAS gene in breast cancer cells. To evaluate this option, FAS- and Her-2/neu-overexpressing SK-Br3 breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with a FAS promoter-reporter construct (FAS-Luciferase) harboring all the elements necessary for high level expression in cancer cells. SK-Br3 cells cultured in the presence of topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) inhibitors doxorubicin and etopoxide (VP-16) demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in FAS promoter activity when compared with control cells growing in drug-free culture conditions. We failed to observe any significant activation of FAS promoter following exposure to the anti-metabolite 5-fluorouracil, the alkylating drug cisplatin, or the microtubule interfering-agents paclitaxel and vincristine. Moreover, the up-regulatory effects of TOP2A inhibitors on the transcriptional activation of FAS gene expression were not significantly decreased when the FAS promoter was damaged at the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-binding site. Considering that FAS inhibition produces profound inhibition of DNA replication and S-phase progression in cancer cells, we finally asked whether a cross-talk between TOP2A and FAS could exhibit a Her-2/neu-related bi-directional nature. TOP2A protein levels were decreased during treatment with the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab while, concomitantly, FAS promoter activity and FAS protein expression were significantly reduced. Of note, when the expression levels of TOP2A protein were analyzed following exposure of SK-Br3 cells to increasing concentrations of the novel slow-binding FAS inhibitor C75, a dose-dependent reduction in TOP2A expression was observed. Although FAS gene is not physically located in the Her-2/neu-TOP2A amplicon, our present findings strongly suggest that a tight functional association between FAS, Her-2/neu and TOP2A genes is taking place in a subset of breast carcinoma cells.
17408310	Application of the bradford hill criteria to assess the causality of cisapride-induced arrhythmia: a model for assessing causal association in pharmacovigilance.	INTRODUCTION: The Bradford Hill criteria are a widely used, useful tool for the assessment of biomedical causation. We have examined their application to pharmacovigilance using the example of cisapride-induced QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Reactions Weekly and regulatory websites to identify evidence for the association between cisapride and QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia that had been published in the English language. Two hundred and five publications were identified as being potentially suitable for the study. After excluding irrelevant articles, studies on high-risk populations and review articles, 70 publications were assessed using the Bradford Hill criteria. These included 24 case reports, case series or spontaneous report summaries; eight epidemiological studies; 22 clinical studies; and 16 experimental (in vivo and in vitro) publications. RESULTS: The most compelling evidence for an association between cisapride use and QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia came from case/spontaneous reports and biological plausibility. Considering the rare incidence of serious cardiac events, these criteria formed the basis for the strength of the association. The number of reports from different populations showed consistency. Specificity was supported by clinical and cardiographic characterisation of the events. There were temporal relationships between the events and the initiation of cisapride treatment, increases in the dosage and the receipt of interacting medications. The relationships between the adverse events and the latter two factors exhibited biological gradients. Experimental evidence could be found from biological models, as well as reports of positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge found in individual patients. Cisapride was found to bind the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channel, which provides a plausible mechanism for QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia. Other QTc interval-prolonging/arrhythmic drugs that also bind to HERG provided an analogy for cisapride causing QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia via this mechanism. The evidence provided by clinical studies was inconsistent, and epidemiological studies failed to demonstrate an association. Nevertheless, this did not prevent the assessment of causation. DISCUSSION: This study showed how different types of evidence found in pharmacovigilance can be evaluated using the Bradford Hill criteria. Further work is required to examine how the criteria can be applied to different types of adverse events and how they may be applied to pharmacovigilance.
16876126	RNA interference-triggered reversal of ABCC2-dependent cisplatin resistance in human cancer cells.	The adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC)-transporter ABCC2 (MRP2/cMOAT) can mediate resistance against the commonly used anticancer drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel. To overcome the ABCC2-depending drug resistance, two specific anti-ABCC2 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were designed for transient triggering of the gene-silencing RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in the cisplatin-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780RCIS. Since both siRNAs showed biological activity, for stable inhibition of ABCC2 a corresponding short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-encoding expression vector was designed. By treatment of A2780RCIS cells with this construct, the expressions of the targeted ABCC2 encoding mRNA and transport protein were inhibited. These effects were accompanied by reversal of resistance against cisplatin and paclitaxel. Thus, the data demonstrate the utility of the analyzed RNAs as powerful laboratory tools and indicate that siRNA- and shRNA-mediated RNAi-based gene therapeutic approaches may be applicable in preventing and reversing ABCC2-depending drug resistance.
6433001	Effects of metal cations and calmodulin antagonists on [3H] nitrendipine binding in smooth and cardiac muscle.	It was previously reported that [3H]nitrendipine binding to a microsomal fraction from intestinal smooth muscle was dependent upon the presence of divalent metal cations (Bolger et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 225: 291-309, 1983). The effects of cations and calmodulin antagonists on [3H]nitrendipine binding in smooth and cardiac muscle have been studied further. Treatment of ileal and aortic smooth muscle and cardiac muscle with EDTA reduced specific [3H]nitrendipine binding by 70 to 95%. Microsomes from rabbit ventricle were more resistant to EDTA treatment than were those from ileal smooth muscle, but low concentrations of Ca++ (less than 10(-5) M) produced half-maximal restoration of binding in both tissues. The ability of cations at a concentration of 10(-3) M to restore binding to membranes from guinea-pig ileum was in the sequence, Ca++ = Sr++ greater than Mg++ = Mn++ = Co++ greater than Ba++ = Ni++ greater than Zn++ = Cd++ greater than La = Sm = Tm . In contrast to the activation of calmodulin-dependent processes, the ability of these cations to restore [3H]nitrendipine binding did not correlate linearly with ionic radius. However, calmodulin antagonists were found to inhibit [3H]nitrendipine binding with the order of potency: pimozide greater than less than calmidazolium (R 24571) greater than trifluoperazine greater than chlorpromazine greater than promethazine greater than chlorpromazine sulfoxide, that correlates quite well with the potency of these drugs as inhibitors of calmodulin-dependent processes. The results suggest that calmodulin antagonists bind to a protein associated with the [3H]nitrendipine binding site that has a hydrophobic domain similar to that exposed on calmodulin by Ca++, but that this protein is not calmodulin itself.
16981227	Effects of DRD2 and CYP2D6 genotypes on delta EEG power response to aripiprazole in healthy male volunteers: a preliminary study.	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms in dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genes on delta EEG power response to aripiprazole in healthy male volunteers. Seventeen volunteers were recruited according to the DRD2 Taq1A genotype, and separated into the following groups: homozygous wild-type (A2/A2, n = 7), heterozygous (A2/A1, n = 5) and homozygous variant-type (A1/A1, n = 5) groups. After enrollment in this study, they were genotyped for CYP2D6. The volunteers received single 10 mg oral doses of aripiprazole, in accordance with an open-label parallel group study design. Plasma levels of aripiprazole and its metabolite were determined and EEGs were obtained simultaneously. The pharmacodynamic parameter was absolute delta power in the Cz channel. The changes of delta power were not different according to DRD2 Taq1A genotypes. As to the CYP2D6 allele, the subjects had the following CYP2D6 genotypes: *10/*10 (n = 4), *1/*10 (n = 5), *1/*5 (n = 2), *1/*1 (n = 3), *2/*41 (n = 1), *2/*2 (n = 1), *2N/*10 (n = 1). Subjects exhibiting the *1/*5 and *1/*10 genotypes showed a trend toward high area under the plasma aripiprazole concentration-time curve (AUC), which was linearly related to area under the EEG response-time curve (AUEC). Our results demonstrate a need for further evaluation of the CYP2D6 genotypic effect on the pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole.
23192350	Silencing α1,3-fucosyltransferases in human leukocytes reveals a role for FUT9 enzyme during E-selectin-mediated cell adhesion.	Leukocyte adhesion during inflammation is initiated by the binding of sialofucosylated carbohydrates expressed on leukocytes to endothelial E/P-selectin. Although the glycosyltransferases (glycoTs) constructing selectin-ligands have largely been identified using knock-out mice, important differences may exist between humans and mice. To address this, we developed a systematic lentivirus-based shRNA delivery workflow to create human leukocytic HL-60 cell lines that lack up to three glycoTs. Using this, the contributions of all three myeloid α1,3-fucosyltransferases (FUT4, FUT7, and FUT9) to selectin-ligand biosynthesis were evaluated. The cell adhesion properties of these modified cells to L-, E-, and P-selectin under hydrodynamic shear were compared with bone marrow-derived neutrophils from Fut4(-/-)Fut7(-/-) dual knock-out mice. Results demonstrate that predominantly FUT7, and to a lesser extent FUT4, forms the selectin-ligand at the N terminus of leukocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in humans and mice. Here, 85% reduction in leukocyte interaction was observed in human FUT4(-)7(-) dual knockdowns on P/L-selectin substrates. Unlike Fut4(-/-)Fut7(-/-) mouse neutrophils, however, human knockdowns lacking FUT4 and FUT7 only exhibited partial reduction in rolling interaction on E-selectin. In this case, the third α1,3-fucosyltransferase FUT9 played an important role because leukocyte adhesion was reduced by 50-60% in FUT9-HL-60, 70-80% in dual knockdown FUT7(-)9(-) cells, and ∼85% in FUT4(-)7(-)9(-) triple knockdowns. Gene silencing results are in agreement with gain-of-function experiments where all three fucosyltransferases conferred E-selectin-mediated rolling in HEK293T cells. This study advances new tools to study human glycoT function. It suggests a species-specific role for FUT9 during the biosynthesis of human E-selectin ligands.
23117207	The S349T mutation of SQSTM1 links Keap1/Nrf2 signalling to Paget's disease of bone.	Mutations affecting the Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) gene commonly occur in patients with the skeletal disorder Paget's disease of bone (PDB), a condition characterised by defective osteoclast differentiation and function. Whilst most mutations cluster within the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of the SQSTM1 protein, and are associated with dysregulated NFκB signalling, several non-UBA domain mutations have also been identified. Keap1 is a SQSTM1-interacting protein that regulates the levels and activity of the Nrf2 transcription factor. This in turn controls the expression of numerous cytoprotective genes that contribute to the cell's capacity to defend itself against chemical and oxidative stress, through binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). The PDB-associated S349T mutation maps to the Keap1-interacting region (KIR) of SQSTM1, however the effects of PDB mutant SQSTM1 on Keap1 function have not been investigated. Here we show that unlike other SQSTM1 mutations, the S349T mutation results in neither impaired ubiquitin-binding function in pull-down assays, nor dysregulated NFκB signalling in luciferase reporter assays. Keap1 is expressed in differentiating osteoclast-like cells and the S349T mutation selectively impairs the SQSTM1-Keap1 interaction in co-immunoprecipitations, which molecular modelling indicates results from effects on critical hydrogen bonds required to stabilise the KIR-Keap1 complex. Further, S349T mutant SQSTM1, but not other PDB-associated mutants, showed reduced ability to activate Nrf2 signalling as assessed by ARE-luciferase reporter assays. Thus, SQSTM1-mediated dysregulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 axis, which could potentially lead to aberrant production of oxidative response genes, may contribute to disease aetiology in a subset of PDB patients.
23526814	tert-Butylcarbamate-Containing Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors: Apoptosis Induction, Cytodifferentiation, and Antiproliferative Activities in Cancer Cells.	Herein we report novel pyrrole- and benzene-based hydroxamates (8, 10) and 2'-aminoanilides (9, 11) bearing the tert-butylcarbamate group at the CAP moiety as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Compounds 8 b and 10 c selectively inhibited HDAC6 at the nanomolar level, whereas the other hydroxamates effected an increase in acetyl-α-tubulin levels in human acute myeloid leukemia U937 cells. In the same cell line, compounds 8 b and 10 c elicited 18.4 and 21.4 % apoptosis, respectively (SAHA: 16.9 %), and the pyrrole anilide 9 c displayed the highest cytodifferentiating effect (90.9 %). In tests against a wide range of various cancer cell lines to determine its antiproliferative effects, compound 10 c exhibited growth inhibition from sub-micromolar (neuroblastoma LAN-5 and SH-SY5Y cells, chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells) to low-micromolar (lung H1299 and A549, colon HCT116 and HT29 cancer cells) concentrations. In HT29 cells, 10 c increased histone H3 acetylation, and decreased the colony-forming potential of the cancer cells by up to 60 %.
15240758	Electrophysiological properties of mouse horizontal cell GABAA receptors.	GABA-induced currents have been characterized in isolated horizontal cells from lower vertebrates but not in mammalian horizontal cells. Therefore horizontal cells were isolated after enzymatical and mechanical dissociation of the adult mouse retina and visually identified. We recorded from horizontal cell bodies using the whole cell and outside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Extracellular application of GABA induced inward currents carried by chloride ions. GABA-evoked currents were completely and reversibly blocked by the competitive GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (IC50 = 1.7 microM), indicating expression of GABAA but not GABAC receptors. Their affinity for GABA was moderate (EC50 = 30 microM), and the Hill coefficient was 1.3, corresponding to two GABA binding sites. GABA responses were partially reduced by picrotoxin with differential effects on peak and steady-state current values. Zinc blocked the GABA response with an IC50 value of 7.3 microM in a noncompetitive manner. Furthermore, GABA receptors of horizontal cells were modulated by extracellular application of diazepam, zolpidem, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboxylate, pentobarbital, and alphaxalone, thus showing typical pharmacological properties of CNS GABAA receptors. GABA-evoked single-channel currents were characterized by a main conductance state of 29.8 pS and two subconductance states (20.2 and 10.8 pS, respectively). Kinetic analysis of single-channel events within bursts revealed similar mean open and closed times for the main conductance and the 20.2-pS subconductance state, resulting in open probabilities of 44.6 and 42.7%, respectively. The ratio of open to closed times, however, was significantly different for the 10.8-pS subconductance state with an open probability of 57.2%.
2751392	Developmental changes in lactate dehydrogenase-X activity in young jaundiced male rats.	This study was designed to examine the testicular maturation in both jaundiced (jj) and nonjaundiced (Jj) male Gunn rats as indicated by the activity of a testis and sperm-specific enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase-X (LDH-X), and serum testosterone levels. Testicular cytosolic LDH-X activity was determined by oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Serum testosterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Testicular LDH-X activity increased rapidly between 30 and 50 days of age in both Jj and jj Gunn rats. LDH-X activity was significantly lower in the jj Gunn rats at 50 and 60 days of age. Testosterone level was significantly lower in the jj Gunn rats at 50 days of age. LDH-X activity and serum testosterone levels were similar for both genotypes at 180 days of age. The delay of testicular maturation in the jaundiced males seems to be due to lower LDH-X activity and serum testosterone levels.
16538493	Thymidylate synthase expression in resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer: role as predictive or prognostic marker?	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Thymidylate synthase (TS) is an important enzyme for DNA synthesis and the target for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Its expression may determine the outcome of patients with gastrointestinal cancers. We examined the prognostic and predictive value of TS-protein expression in patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. METHODS: TS expression from 131 patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded primary tumour specimens or biopsies. RESULTS: The median disease-specific survival among all patients (n=131) was 13 months. The invasion depth, the presence of metastases, grading and Union Internationale Contre le Cancer [International Union Against Cancer] (UICC) stage were associated with survival. Among resected patients (n=98), a difference in median survival was seen in the group receiving postoperative adjuvant treatment (21.1 months) compared with the group treated by surgery alone (12.4 months) (p=0.025). Low- and high-TS immunoreactivity was present in 74 (56%) and 56 (43%) of the cancers, respectively. One sample was not evaluable. No difference in median survival was observed among low- and high-TS-expressing tumours. Among patients undergoing resection and receiving postoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy (n=23), a marked trend to a longer median survival was seen for the group with low-TS-expressing tumours compared with the corresponding high-TS group (25.0 vs 16.0 months) (p=0.3834). There was no difference in survival among all palliative treated patients with low- and high-TS-expressing tumours. CONCLUSION: Especially patients undergoing tumour resection with low-TS values seemed to have taken advantage from an intensified postoperative chemotherapeutic protocol. However due to the heterogeneous group of patients in the present report, larger trials of more homogenous patient populations will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
15500910	Unique kinetic mechanism of Plasmodium falciparum adenylosuccinate synthetase.	Adenylosuccinate synthetase (AdSS) catalyses the Mg(2+) dependent formation of adenylosuccinate from IMP and aspartate, the reaction being driven by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. All characterized AdSS thus far exhibit a random kinetic mechanism. We present here kinetic evidence that unlike all other AdSS, Plasmodium falciparum AdSS (PfAdSS) has ordered substrate binding. Inhibition studies show that binding of GTP requires IMP binding while aspartate binds to the enzyme-IMP-GTP complex. A structural basis for this difference in mechanism is presented. Kinetically, PfAdSS is closer to the mouse acidic isozyme rather than to the mouse basic isozyme. The mouse acidic isozyme is thought to play a role in the purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. Regulation of PfAdSS in vivo can therefore, be expected to be similar to the mouse acidic isozyme, in agreement with the role of PfAdSS as the only pathway for the synthesis of adenine nucleotides in the parasite. However, PfAdSS differs from both the mammalian homologs in that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a potent inhibitor of the mammalian enzyme, is an activator of PfAdSS. The differences highlighted here are promising in terms of species-specific drug design, targeting this essential enzyme in the parasite.
23178198	Etazolate, an α-secretase activator, reduces neuroinflammation and offers persistent neuroprotection following traumatic brain injury in mice.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) evokes an intense neuroinflammatory reaction that is essentially mediated by activated microglia and that has been reported to act as a secondary injury mechanism that further promotes neuronal death. It involves the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines and the diminution of neuroprotective and neurotrophic factors, such as the soluble form alpha of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPPα), generated by the activity of α-secretases. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of etazolate, an α-secretase activator, on acute and belated post-TBI consequences. The mouse model of TBI by mechanical percussion was used and injured mice received either the vehicle or etazolate at the dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg at 2 h post-TBI. Neurological score, cerebral œdema, IL-1β and sAPPα levels, microglial activation and lesion size were evaluated from 6 to 24 h post-TBI. Spontaneous locomotor activity was evaluated from 48 h to 12 weeks post-TBI, memory function at 5 weeks and olfactory bulb lesions at 13 weeks post-TBI. A single administration of etazolate exerted a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory and anti-œdematous effect accompanied by lasting memory improvement, reduction of locomotor hyperactivity and olfactory bulb tissue protection, with a therapeutic window of at least 2 h. These effects were associated with the restoration of the levels of the sAPPα protein post-TBI. Taken together, these results highlight for the first time the therapeutic interest of an α-secretase activator in TBI.
10847421	Dose-dependent release of endogenous tissue factor pathway inhibitor by different low molecular weight heparins.	Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is released to circulating blood after intravenous and subcutaneous injections of heparins, and may thus contribute to the antithrombotic effect of heparins. A previous study suggested different abilities of various low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) to release endogenous TFPI, but the dose-response relationship was not determined. In the present study, the dose-response relationship for escalating doses of two LMWHs, dalteparin and enoxaparin, on the release of endogenous TFPI was investigated. Six healthy male participants were given 50, 100 and 200 U/kg dalteparin and 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg enoxaparin as a single subcutaneous injection. The study was a randomized, cross-over design with a 1-week wash-out period between each injection. Peak free TFPI antigen and TFPI activity were detected after only 1 h, whereas anti-activated factor X (anti-FXa) and anti-activated factor II (anti-FIIa) activities were detected after 2-6 h. Putative therapeutic equivalent doses of dalteparin and enoxaparin gave similar release of endogenous TFPI, but dissimilar effects on anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activities.
23609438	The Intermediate-conductance Calcium-activated Potassium Channel KCa3.1 Regulates Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation via Controlling Calcium-dependent Signaling.	The intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel KCa3.1 contributes to a variety of cell activation processes in pathologies such as inflammation, carcinogenesis and vascular remodeling. We examined the electrophysiological and transcriptional mechanisms by which KCa3.1 regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF)-induced proliferation of human coronary artery VSMCs was attenuated by lowering intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and was enhanced by elevating [Ca(2+)]i. KCa3.1 blockade or knockdown inhibited proliferation by suppressing the rise in [Ca(2+)]i and attenuating the expression of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), c-fos and neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 (NOR-1). This anti-proliferative effect was abolished by elevating [Ca(2+)]i. KCa3.1 overexpression induced VSMC proliferation, and potentiated PDGF-induced proliferation, by inducing CREB phosphorylation, c-fos and NOR-1. Pharmacological stimulation of KCa3.1 unexpectedly suppressed proliferation by inhibiting the rise in [Ca(2+)]i and abolishing the expression and activity of KCa3.1 and PDGF β-receptors. The stimulation also attenuated the levels of phosphorylated CREB, c-fos and cyclins expression. After KCa3.1 blockade, the characteristic round shape of VSMCs expressing high l-caldesmon and low calponin-1 (dedifferentiation state) was maintained, whereas KCa3.1 stimulation induced a spindle-shape cellular appearance, with low l-caldesmon and high calponin-1. In conclusion, KCa3.1 plays an important role in VSMC proliferation via controlling Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways and its modulation may therefore constitute a new therapeutic target for cell proliferative diseases such as atherosclerosis.
23434193	The role of omega-3 derived resolvins in arthritis.	Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are known to alleviate joint stiffness and pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients. However, the mechanisms by which omega-3s exert their beneficial effects has not been fully explored. Herein we discuss a novel class of bioactive lipid mediators, which are enzymatically biosynthesized in vivo from omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), termed resolvins. These lipid mediators exert anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties and are log-orders more potent than their precursors. We also highlight that formation of pro-resolving mediators can be enhanced by widely used anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective drugs (aspirin and statins) via the modification of cyclooxygenase-2 enzymatic activity. These bioactive pro-resolving lipid mediators provide further rationale for the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with fish oils, and offer new avenues for developing therapeutics for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
14530799	The neuropharmacological basis for the use of memantine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.	Memantine has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the neurobiological basis for the therapeutic activity of memantine is not fully understood, the drug is not a cholinesterase inhibitor and, therefore, acts differently from current AD therapies. Memantine can interact with a variety of ligand-gated ion channels. However, NMDA receptors appear to be a key target of memantine at therapeutic concentrations. Memantine is an uncompetitive (channel blocking) NMDA receptor antagonist. Like other NMDA receptor antagonists, memantine at high concentrations can inhibit mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that are believed to underlie learning and memory. However, at lower, clinically relevant concentrations memantine can under some circumstances promote synaptic plasticity and preserve or enhance memory in animal models of AD. In addition, memantine can protect against the excitotoxic destruction of cholinergic neurons. Blockade of NMDA receptors by memantine could theoretically confer disease-modifying activity in AD by inhibiting the "weak" NMDA receptor-dependent excitotoxicity that has been hypothesized to play a role in the progressive neuronal loss that underlies the evolving dementia. Moreover, recent in vitro studies suggest that memantine abrogates beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity and possibly inhibits Abeta production. Considerable attention has focused on the investigation of theories to explain the better tolerability of memantine over other NMDA receptor antagonists, particularly those that act by a similar channel blocking mechanism such as dissociative anesthetic-like agents (phencyclidine, ketamine, MK-801). A variety of channel-level factors could be relevant, including fast channel-blocking kinetics and strong voltage-dependence (allowing rapid relief of block during synaptic activity), as well as reduced trapping (permitting egress from closed channels). These factors may allow memantine to block channel activity induced by low, tonic levels of glutamate--an action that might contribute to symptomatic improvement and could theoretically protect against weak excitotoxicity--while sparing synaptic responses required for normal behavioral functioning, cognition and memory.
12431845	Atomoxetine increases extracellular levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in prefrontal cortex of rat: a potential mechanism for efficacy in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	The selective norepinephrine (NE) transporter inhibitor atomoxetine (formerly called tomoxetine or LY139603) has been shown to alleviate symptoms in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We investigated the mechanism of action of atomoxetine in ADHD by evaluating the interaction of atomoxetine with monoamine transporters, the effects on extracellular levels of monoamines, and the expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos in brain regions. Atomoxetine inhibited binding of radioligands to clonal cell lines transfected with human NE, serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) transporters with dissociation constants (K(i)) values of 5, 77 and 1451 nM, respectively, demonstrating selectivity for NE transporters. In microdialysis studies, atomoxetine increased extracellular (EX) levels of NE in prefrontal cortex (PFC) 3-fold, but did not alter 5-HT(EX) levels. Atomoxetine also increased DA(EX) concentrations in PFC 3-fold, but did not alter DA(EX) in striatum or nucleus accumbens. In contrast, the psychostimulant methylphenidate, which is used in ADHD therapy, increased NE(EX) and DA(EX) equally in PFC, but also increased DA(EX) in the striatum and nucleus accumbens to the same level. The expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos was increased 3.7-fold in PFC by atomoxetine administration, but was not increased in the striatum or nucleus accumbens, consistent with the regional distribution of increased DA(EX). We hypothesize that the atomoxetine-induced increase of catecholamines in PFC, a region involved in attention and memory, mediates the therapeutic effects of atomoxetine in ADHD. In contrast to methylphenidate, atomoxetine did not increase DA in striatum or nucleus accumbens, suggesting it would not have motoric or drug abuse liabilities.
16855093	The glutamate-aspartate transporter GLAST mediates glutamate uptake at inner hair cell afferent synapses in the mammalian cochlea.	Ribbon synapses formed between inner hair cells (IHCs) and afferent dendrites in the mammalian cochlea can sustain high rates of release, placing strong demands on glutamate clearance mechanisms. To investigate the role of transporters in glutamate removal at these synapses, we made whole-cell recordings from IHCs, afferent dendrites, and glial cells adjacent to IHCs [inner phalangeal cells (IPCs)] in whole-mount preparations of rat organ of Corti. Focal application of the transporter substrate D-aspartate elicited inward currents in IPCs, which were larger in the presence of anions that permeate the transporter-associated anion channel and blocked by the transporter antagonist D,L-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate. These currents were produced by glutamate-aspartate transporters (GLAST) (excitatory amino acid transporter 1) because they were weakly inhibited by dihydrokainate, an antagonist of glutamate transporter-1 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2) and were absent from IPCs in GLAST-/- cochleas. Furthermore, D-aspartate-induced currents in outside-out patches from IPCs exhibited larger steady-state currents than responses elicited by L-glutamate, a prominent feature of GLAST, and examination of cochlea from GLAST-Discosoma red (DsRed) promoter reporter mice revealed that DsRed expression was restricted to IPCs and other supporting cells surrounding IHCs. Saturation of transporters by photolysis of caged D-aspartate failed to elicit transporter currents in IHCs, as did local application of D-aspartate to afferent terminals, indicating that neither presynaptic nor postsynaptic membranes are major sites for glutamate removal. These data indicate that GLAST in supporting cells is responsible for transmitter uptake at IHC afferent synapses.
2865685	Beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor binding and functional response in right and left atria of rat heart.	The properties of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in right and left atria of rat heart, and their roles in mediating chronotropic and inotropic responses to beta-adrenoceptor agonists were examined. [125I](-)pindolol (125IPIN) bound saturably and specifically to a single class of high affinity sites in homogenates of both right and left atria. The k1's for association in right and left atria were 6.5 X 10(9) l/mol-min and 2.3 X 10(9) l/mol-min respectively, while the k-1's for dissociation were 0.20 min-1 and 0.17 min-1. The kinetically determined KD's were 75 pmol/l in right and 30 pmol/l in left atria and were similar to the equilibrium KD's determined from Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms of specific 125IPIN binding. Inhibition of 125IPIN binding by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was stereoselective and the order of potency was timolol greater than l-propranolol greater than d-propranolol greater than sotalol. Inhibition by beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype selective antagonists yielded flat displacement curves with low Hill coefficients. Nonlinear regression analysis of displacement by beta 1-selective (practolol, atenolol and metoprolol) and beta 2-selective (ICI 118,551) antagonists gave estimates of the proportion of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors present in rat atria. Right atria contained 67 +/- 4.2% beta 1- and 33 +/- 4.2% beta 2-adrenoceptors, while left atria contained 67 +/- 2.8% beta 1- and 33 +/- 2.8% beta 2-adrenoceptors. Increases in the rate of spontaneously beating right atria and the force of electrically driven left atria caused by beta-adrenoceptor agonists were also measured. pA2 values for non-subtype selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in inhibiting isoprenaline-induced increases in rate and force were highly correlated with KD values determined for specific 125IPIN binding. pA2 values for beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists in inhibiting isoprenaline-induced increases in rate and force correlated well with the pKD values of these drugs in binding to beta 1-adrenoceptors, but not with the pKD values in binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors. Dose-response curves for stimulation of both rate and force by the beta 2-selective agonists procaterol and zinterol were shifted to a much greater extent by selective blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors with metoprolol than by selective blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors with ICI 118,551, suggesting that these compounds caused their effects by activating beta 1-adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
10643177	COX-2-specific inhibition: implications for clinical practice.	Although conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been a major therapeutic choice for the management of arthritic conditions, the potential adverse effects of these agents sometimes compromise their clinical utility. New modes of therapy have recently been introduced, and data on the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib suggest that these agents will meet the need for safe and effective therapeutic alternatives to conventional NSAIDs.
12414107	Localization of sepiapterin reductase in the human brain.	Sepiapterin reductase (SPR) is the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), tryptophan hydroxylase, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Although SPR is essential for synthesizing BH4, the distribution of SPR in the human brain has not yet been clarified. In the present study, we purified recombinant human SPR from cDNA, raised an antibody against human SPR (hSPR), and examined the localization of SPR protein and SPR activity. Human brain homogenates from the substantia nigra (SN), caudate nucleus (CN), gray and white matters of the cerebral cortex (CTX), and dorsal and ventral parts of the medulla oblongata (MO) were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-hSPR antibody or with anti-TH antibody. Whereas TH protein showed a restricted localization, being mainly detected in the SN and CN, SPR protein was detected in all brain regions examined. SPR activity was relatively high compared with the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH), the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme of BH4, and was more widely distributed than GCH activity. Immunohistochemistry revealed SPR immunoreactivity in pyramidal neurons in the cerebral CTX, in a small number of striatal neurons, and in neurons of the hypothalamic and brain stem monoaminergic fields and olivary nucleus. Double-staining immunohistochemistry showed that TH and SPR were colocalized in the SN dopamine neurons. Localization of SPR immunoreactive neurons corresponded to monoamine or NOS neuronal fields, and also to the areas where no monoamine or NOS neurons were located. The results indicate that there might be a BH4 biosynthetic pathway where GCH is not involved and that SPR might have some yet unidentified function(s) in addition to BH4 biosynthesis.
10659603	[New prospects in the treatment of migraine].	The options for migraine treatment have increased in the recent years and will expand in the near future. In this work both recent and future options for migraine treatment are critically reviewed. Firstly the late advances in the symptomatic treatment of migraine, including the new 5-HT1B/D agonists "triptans" appeared after sumatriptan, are reviewed. Possible alternative, such as selective 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F agonists, are also discussed. In the second part of this manuscript the new, possible options for the preventive treatment of migraine comprising "antiepileptics", such as valproic acid, gabapentin and topiramate, calcium-antagonists, such as cyclandelate and dotarizin, and a miscellany, including riboflavin, are analysed. Finally, possible compounds for the future, such as the selective inhibitors of neurokinin receptors or drugs acting upon neuronal calcium channels, are commented. From this review we conclude that while there have been relevant advances in the symptomatic treatment of migraine, there is a need for the development of better preventive compounds.
17896959	Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitors: a new class of calcium regulators.	The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is a bidirectional transporter that normally extrudes Ca(2+) from the cell (forward mode), but also brings Ca(2+) into the cell (reverse mode) under special conditions such as intracellular Na(+) (Na(+)(i)) accumulation or membrane depolarization. There are three mammalian NCX isoforms: NCX1 is widely expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, blood vessels, and so on; whereas the expression of NCX2 and NCX3 is limited mainly to the brain and skeletal muscle. The pharmacology of NCX inhibitors has been studied extensively since the development of KB-R7943, a prototype benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitor, in 1996. Currently, experiments are actively progressing with more selective inhibitors: SEA0400, SN-6, and YM-244769. Intriguingly, the inhibitory potency of benzyloxyphenyl NCX inhibitors is directly coupled to the rate of Na(+)(i)-dependent inactivation. Therefore, the benzyloxyphenyl inhibitors are apparently dormant during the forward mode under normal conditions (low Na(+)(i)), but become effective during the reverse mode under pathological conditions (high Na(+)(i)). This should be an ideal profile for calcium regulators against Na(+)(i)-related diseases, such as ischemia/reperfusion injuries, salt-dependent hypertension, and digitalis arrhythmia. Existing ion channel blockers, such as amiodarone, dronedarone, bepridil, aprindine, and cibenzoline, have been found to have an NCX inhibitory action. It is possible that this property is partly responsible for their antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective effects. This article presents the characteristics of selective and non-selective NCX inhibitors and their therapeutic potential as a new calcium regulator.
16751798	Group I mGlu receptor stimulation inhibits activation-induced cell death of human T lymphocytes.	1. The effects of L-glutamate on activation-induced cell death (AICD) of human activated (1 microg ml(-1) phytohemagglutinin plus 2 U ml(-1) interleukin-2; 8 days) T lymphocytes were studied by measuring anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (10 microg ml(-1); 18 h)-induced cell apoptosis (Annexin V and propidium iodide staining). 2. L-Glutamate (1 x 10(-8)-1 x 10(-4) M) significantly (P < or = 0.01) inhibited AICD in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50=6.3 x 10(-8) M; maximum inhibition 54.8+/-6.3% at 1 x 10(-6) M). 3. The L-glutamate inhibitory effect was pharmacologically characterized as mediated by group I mGlu receptors, since mGlu receptor agonists reproduced this effect. The EC50 values were: 3.2 x 10(-7) M for (1S,3R)-ACPD; 4.5 x 10(-8) M for quisqualate; 1.0 x 10(-6) M for (S)-3,5-DHPG; 2.0 x 10(-5) M for CHPG. 4. Group I mGlu receptor antagonists inhibited the effects of quisqualate 1.0 x 10(-6) M. The IC50 values calculated were: 8.7 x 10(-5), 4.3 x 10(-6) and 6.3 x 10(-7) M for AIDA, LY 367385 and MPEP, respectively. 5. L-Glutamate (1 x 10(-6) M; 18 h) significantly (P < or = 0.05) inhibited FasL expression (40.8+/-11.3%) (cytofluorimetric analysis), whereas it did not affect Fas signalling. 6. Expression of both mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptor mRNA by T lymphocytes and T-cell lines, as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, suggests that L-glutamate-mediated inhibition of AICD was exerted on T cells. 7. These data depict a novel role for L-glutamate in the regulation of the immune response through group I mGlu receptor-mediated mechanisms.
17355958	Oxidation and S-nitrosylation of cysteines in human cytosolic and mitochondrial glutaredoxins: effects on structure and activity.	Glutathione (GSH) is the major intracellular thiol present in 1-10-mm concentrations in human cells. However, the redox potential of the 2GSH/GSSG (glutathione disulfide) couple in cells varies in association with proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis from -260 mV to -200 or -170 mV. Hydrogen peroxide is transiently produced as second messenger in receptor-mediated growth factor signaling. To understand oxidation mechanisms by GSSG or nitric oxide-related nitrosylation we studied effects on glutaredoxins (Grx), which catalyze GSH-dependent thiol-disulfide redox reactions, particularly reversible glutathionylation of protein sulfhydryl groups. Human Grx1 and Grx2 contain Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys and Cys-Ser-Tyr-Cys active sites and have three and two additional structural Cys residues, respectively. We analyzed the redox state and disulfide pairing of Cys residues upon GSSG oxidation and S-nitrosylation. Cytosolic/nuclear Grx1 was partly inactivated by both S-nitrosylation and oxidation. Inhibition by nitrosylation was reversible under anaerobic conditions; aerobically it was stronger and irreversible, indicating inactivation by nitration. Oxidation of Grx1 induced a complex pattern of disulfide-bonded dimers and oligomers formed between Cys-8 and either Cys-79 or Cys-83. In addition, an intramolecular disulfide between Cys-79 and Cys-83 was identified, predicted to have a profound effect on the three-dimensional structure. In contrast, mitochondrial Grx2 retains activity upon oxidation, did not form disulfide-bonded dimers or oligomers, and could not be S-nitrosylated. The dimeric iron sulfur cluster-coordinating inactive form of Grx2 dissociated upon nitrosylation, leading to activation of the protein. The striking differences between Grx1 and Grx2 reflect their diverse regulatory functions in vivo and also adaptation to different subcellular localization.
11181577	A nonsense mutation in the NDUFS4 gene encoding the 18 kDa (AQDQ) subunit of complex I abolishes assembly and activity of the complex in a patient with Leigh-like syndrome.	Sequence analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear candidate genes of complex I in children with deficiency of this complex and exhibiting Leigh-like syndrome has revealed, in one of them, a novel mutation in the NDUFS4 gene encoding the 18 kDa subunit. Phosphorylation of this subunit by cAMP-dependent protein kinase has previously been found to activate the complex. The present mutation consists of a homozygous G-->A transition at nucleotide position +44 of the coding sequence of the gene, resulting in the change of a tryptophan codon to a stop codon. Such mutation causes premature termination of the protein after only 14 amino acids of the putative mitochondrial targeting peptide. Fibroblast cultures from the patient exhibited severe reduction of the rotenone-sensitive NADH-->UQ oxidoreductase activity of complex I, which was insensitive to cAMP stimulation. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed the absence of detectable normally assembled complex I in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These findings show that the expression of the NDUFS4 gene is essential for the assembly of a functional complex I.
12824918	Colon cancer cells with high invasive potential are susceptible to induction of apoptosis by a selective COX-2 inhibitor.	Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression has been shown to correlate with the invasiveness of colon cancer cells. To further investigate this positive correlation and its possible therapeutic implications, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, etodolac, was tested on three variants of HT-29 colon cancer cell lines, HT-29/Inv1, HT-29/Inv2 and HT-29/Inv3, with graded increases of in vitro Matrigel invasive potential and COX-2 expression levels. HT-29 variants with higher invasive potential were found to be more sensitive to etodolac by in vitro growth inhibition assays, the estimated LD(50) being 0.5 mM for highly invasive HT-29/Inv2 and HT-29/Inv3 cells, 0.6 mM for slightly less invasive HT-29/Inv1, and 1.8 mM for the parental HT-29. Treatment of the highly invasive HT-29/Inv2 and Inv3 variants with as little as 0.1 mM etodolac in the growth medium produced signs of apoptosis, as detected by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) assay. In vivo experiments in SCID mice showed that etolodac inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors induced by HT-29/Inv3 cells significantly more than those by the parental HT-29 cells. These results suggest that COX-2 inhibitors have a potential role in prevention of tumor invasion in colon cancer patients.
23435615	The (R)-omeprazole hydroxylation index reflects CYP2C19 activity in healthy Japanese volunteers.	PURPOSE: Omeprazole has (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, which exhibit different pharmacokinetics (PK) among patients with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 genotype groups. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the 1-point, 4-h postdose (R)-omeprazole hydroxylation index (HI) of racemic omeprazole reflects the three CYP2C19 genotype groups in Japanese individuals. METHODS: Ninety healthy Japanese individuals were enrolled and classified into the three different CYP2C19 genotype groups: homozygous extensive metabolizers (hmEMs; n = 34), heterozygous EMs (htEMs; n = 44), and poor metabolizers (PMs; n = 12). Blood samples were drawn 4 h after the intake of an oral dose of omeprazole 40 mg, and plasma levels of omeprazole and its metabolites were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral column. RESULTS: Mean plasma concentrations of (R)- and (S)-omeprazole in PMs were significantly higher than those in hmEMs and htEMs, and similar results were obtained in the case of omeprazole sulfone. Additionally, there was a significant difference in plasma concentrations of (R)-5-hydroxyomeprazole among CYP2C19 genotype groups, whereas no significant differences were observed in that of (S)-5-hydroxyomeprazole. Similarly, (R)-omeprazole HI in hmEMs, htEMs, and PMs were 5.6, 3.1, and 0.3, respectively, which were significantly different, but no significant difference was present in the (S)-omeprazole HI. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that (R)-omeprazole HI correlated better with CYP2C19 genotype groups than racemic-omeprazole HI, and these results may be useful for classification among patients in CYP2C19 genotype groups prior to omeprazole treatment.
23015691	Quantitative analysis of the interaction of constitutive androstane receptor with chemicals and steroid receptor coactivator 1 using surface plasmon resonance biosensor systems: a case study of the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica) and the mouse.	The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) not only displays a high basal transcriptional activity but also acts as a ligand-dependent transcriptional factor. It is known that CAR exhibits different ligand profiles across species. However, the mechanisms underlying CAR activation by chemicals and the species-specific responses are not fully understood. The objectives of this study are to establish a high-throughput tool to screen CAR ligands and to clarify how CAR proteins from the Baikal seal (bsCAR) and the mouse (mCAR) interact with chemicals and steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1). We developed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system to assess quantitatively the interaction of CAR with potential ligands and SRC1. The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of bsCAR and mCAR was synthesized in a wheat germ cell-free system. The purified CAR LBD was then immobilized on the sensor chip for the SPR assay, and the kinetics of direct interaction of CARs with ligand candidates was measured. Androstanol and androstenol, estrone, 17β-estradiol, TCPOBOP, and CITCO showed compound-specific but similar affinities for both CARs. The CAR-SRC1 interaction was ligand dependent but exhibited a different ligand profile between the seal and the mouse. The results of SRC1 interaction assay accounted for those of our previous in vitro CAR-mediated transactivation assay. In silico analyses also supported the results of CAR-SRC1 interaction; there is little structural difference in the ligand-binding pocket of bsCAR and mCAR, but there is a distinct discrimination in the helix 11 and 12 of these receptors, suggesting that the interaction of ligand-bound CAR and SRC1 is critical for determining species-specific and ligand-dependent transactivation over the basal activity. The SPR assays demonstrated a potential as a high-throughput screening tool of CAR ligands.
12842269	Binding and GTPgammaS autoradiographic analysis of preproorphanin precursor peptide products at the ORL1 and opioid receptors.	Utilizing agonist-stimulated GTPgammaS autoradiography, we analyzed the ability of preproorphanin FQ (ppOFQ) peptides to stimulate [35S]-GTPgammaS binding in adult rat brain. Orphanin FQ (OFQ) stimulated [35S]-GTPgammaS binding in a pattern similar to that described for [125I]-OFQ at the endogenous opioid receptor-like (ORL1) receptor. The ppOFQ peptides nocistatin and orphanin FQ2 (OFQ II(1-17)) had no effect, suggesting that they do not mediate their reported analgesic effects via a G(i/o)-coupled receptor (i.e. opioid or ORL1). Unlike OFQ II(1-17), high concentrations of its C-terminal extension, OFQ II(1-28), stimulated [35S]-GTPgammaS binding in a mu (mu) opioid receptor-like distribution and the effect was blocked by naloxone. To explore these observations, we evaluated the receptor binding profile of OFQ II(1-28) at the cloned ORL1 and mu opioid receptors. OFQ II(1-28) had no specific binding at either ORL1 or mu opioid receptors at concentrations up to 50 microM. This lack of affinity was not consistent with a mu-mediated effect, as suggested by preliminary observation using functional autoradiography in rat brain sections. Although behavioral studies suggest that OFQ II(1-28) possesses analgesic activity, this effect does not appear to be mediated via direct binding at the mu opioid receptor. Taken together, these findings support the view that (1) OFQ is the only ppOFQ peptide that binds to and activates the ORL1 receptor and (2) OFQ II(1-28) does not bind or stimulate [35S]-GTPgammaS binding in cells expressing the mu opioid receptor.
23444387	Significance of reductive metabolism in human intestine and quantitative prediction of intestinal first-pass metabolism by cytosolic reductive enzymes.	The number of new drug candidates that are cleared via non-cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes has increased. However, unlike oxidation by P450, the roles of reductive enzymes are less understood. The metabolism in intestine is especially not well known. The purposes of this study were to investigate the significance of reductive metabolism in human intestine, and to establish a quantitative prediction method of intestinal first-pass metabolism by cytosolic reductive enzymes, using haloperidol, mebendazole, and ziprasidone. First, we estimated the metabolic activities for these compounds in intestine and liver using subcellular fractions. Metabolic activities were detected in human intestinal cytosol (HIC) for all three compounds, and the intrinsic clearance values were higher than those in human liver cytosol for haloperidol and mebendazole. These metabolic activities in HIC were NADPH- and/or NADH-dependent. Furthermore, the metabolic activities for all three compounds in HIC were largely inhibited by menadione, which has been used as a carbonyl reductase (CBR)-selective chemical inhibitor. Therefore, considering subcellular location, cofactor requirement, and chemical inhibition, these compounds might be metabolized by CBRs in human intestine. Subsequently, we tried to quantitatively predict intestinal availability (Fg) for these compounds using human intestinal S9 (HIS9). Our prediction model using apparent permeability of parallel artificial membrane permeability assay and metabolic activities in HIS9 could predict Fg in humans for the three compounds well. In conclusion, CBRs might have higher metabolic activities in human intestine than in human liver. Furthermore, our prediction method of human Fg using HIS9 is applicable to substrates of cytosolic reductive enzymes.
16313925	Preferential inhibition of human phosphodiesterase 4 by ibudilast.	Ibudilast ophthalmic solution exhibited an improved clinical efficacy over cromoglycate in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. To further characterize its principal mode of action, the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitory profile of ibudilast has been examined using human recombinant enzymes. Ibudilast, but not the other commonly used anti-allergic ophthalmic solutions including cromoglycate, ketotifen, tranilast and levocabastine, potently inhibits purified human PDE4A, 4B, 4C and 4D with IC50 values at 54, 65, 239 and 166 nM, respectively. Ibudilast effectively blocks lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha, IC50 = 6.2 microM) and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-induced leukotriene (LT) B4 biosynthesis (IC50 = 2.5 microM) in human whole blood, which are 3 and 6-fold more potent than cilomilast, respectively. The attenuated inflammatory and allergic responses from the potent and preferential PDE4 inhibition of ibudilast may have contributed significantly to its beneficial pharmacological responses and distinguishes ibudilast from the other ophthalmic solutions in the treatment of ocular allergy.
16636450	Soy protein suppresses gene expression of acetyl-coA carboxylase alpha from promoter PI in rat liver.	Dietary soy protein isolate (SPI) reduces hepatic lipogenesis by suppressing gene expression of lipogenic enzymes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In order to elucidate the mechanism of this regulation, the effect of dietary SPI on promoter (PI and PII) specific gene expression of ACC alpha was investigated. Rats were fed experimental diets containing SPI or casein as a nitrogen source. SPI feeding decreased the hepatic contents of total ACC mRNA as well as triglyceride (TG) content, but dietary SPI affected the amount of sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1 mRNA and protein very little. The amount of ACC mRNA transcribed from PII promoter containing SRE was not significantly affected by dietary protein, while a significant decrease in PI-generated ACC mRNA content was observed in rats fed the SPI diet. These data suggest that SPI feeding decreased the hepatic contents of ACC alpha mRNA mainly by regulating PI promoter via a nuclear factor(s) other than SREBP-1.
6146346	Astemizole, a potent histamine H1-receptor antagonist: effect in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, on antigen and histamine induced skin weal responses and relationship to serum levels.	The efficacy of astemizole, a new, long acting, oral histamine H1-receptor antagonist was compared to placebo for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis during the grass pollen season of 1982. Sixty-three patients with a positive skin prick test to grass pollen and current symptoms participated in an 8 week, double-blind, randomized study. Astemizole, 10 mg, was significantly better than placebo in alleviating both nose (P less than 0.05) and eye (P less than 0.01) symptoms despite significantly greater use of the reserve medication, clemastine, by the placebo group (P less than 0.003). There was a lag period of 5 days after initiation of therapy before treatment benefit became manifest. Subdivision of nasal symptoms indicated significant improvement compared to placebo over the 8 weeks for sneezing (P less than 0.05) and runny nose (P less than 0.05) but not blocked nose. The absence of effect on nasal blockage was confirmed by parallel measurement of nasal calibre by body plethysmography. The antihistaminic potency of astemizole was indicated by an 80% inhibition of the histamine induced skin weal response after 8 weeks therapy. A positive correlation was found between serum drug levels and % inhibition of histamine skin weal (r = 0.64, P less than 0.001). Astemizole was free from adverse sedative or anticholinergic effects but did cause a mean increase in weight of 1.3 kg (P less than 0.01) after 8 weeks therapy, not found with placebo.
16773376	Do nitric oxide donors mimic endogenous NO-related response in plants?	Huge advances achieved recently in elucidating the role of NO in plants have been made possible by the application of NO donors. However, the application of NO to plants in various forms and doses should be subjected to detailed verification criteria. Not all metabolic responses induced by NO donors are reliable and reproducible in other experimental designs. The aim of the presented studies was to investigate the half-life of the most frequently applied donors (SNP, SNAP and GSNO), the rate of NO release under the influence of light and reducing agents. At a comparable donor concentration (500 microM) and under light conditions the highest rate of NO generation was found for SNAP, followed by GSNO and SNP. The measured half-life of the donor in the solution was 3 h for SNAP, 7 h for GSNO and 12 h for SNP. A temporary lack of light inhibited NO release from SNP, both in the solution and SNP-treated leaf tissue, which was measured by the electrochemical method. Also a NO, selective fluorescence indicator DAF-2DA in leaves supplied with different donors showed green fluorescence spots in the epidermal cells mainly in the light. SNP as a NO donor was the most photosensitive. The activity of PAL, which plays an important role in plant defence, was also activated by SNP in the light, not in the dark. S-nitrosothiols (SNAP and GSNO) also underwent photodegradation, although to a lesser degree than SNP. Additionally, NO generation capacity from S-nitrosothiols was shown in the presence of reducing agents, i.e. ascorbic acid and GSH, and the absence of light. The authors of this paper would like to polemicize with the commonly cited statement that "donors are compounds that spontaneously break down to release NO" and wish to point out the fact that the process of donor decomposition depends on the numerous external factors. It may be additionally stimulated or inhibited by live plant tissue, thus it is necessary to take into consideration these aspects and monitor the amount of NO released by the donor.
22884520	Oxysterol generation and liver X receptor-dependent reverse cholesterol transport: not all roads lead to Rome.	Cell cholesterol metabolism is a tightly regulated process, dependent in part on activation of nuclear liver X receptors (LXRs) to increase expression of genes mediating removal of excess cholesterol from cells in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. LXRs are thought to be activated predominantly by oxysterols generated enzymatically from cholesterol in different cell organelles. Defects resulting in slowed release of cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes or reduction in sterol-27-hydroxylase activity lead to specific blocks in oxysterol production and impaired LXR-dependent gene activation. This block does not appear to be compensated by oxysterol production in other cell compartments. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge about oxysterol-dependent activation by LXR of genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport, and what these defects of cell cholesterol homeostasis can teach us about the critical pathways of oxysterol generation for expression of LXR-dependent genes.
23409871	Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of indazole arylsulfonamides as allosteric CC-chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) antagonists.	A series of indazole arylsulfonamides were synthesized and examined as human CCR4 antagonists. Methoxy- or hydroxyl-containing groups were the more potent indazole C4 substituents. Only small groups were tolerated at C5, C6, or C7, with the C6 analogues being preferred. The most potent N3-substituent was 5-chlorothiophene-2-sulfonamide. N1 meta-substituted benzyl groups possessing an α-amino-3-[(methylamino)acyl]-group were the most potent N1-substituents. Strongly basic amino groups had low oral absorption in vivo. Less basic analogues, such as morpholines, had good oral absorption; however, they also had high clearance. The most potent compound with high absorption in two species was analogue 6 (GSK2239633A), which was selected for further development. Aryl sulfonamide antagonists bind to CCR4 at an intracellular allosteric site denoted site II. X-ray diffraction studies on two indazole sulfonamide fragments suggested the presence of an important intramolecular interaction in the active conformation.
12692940	[Study on the effect of cysteinyl leukotriene antagonist, pranlukast hydrate, on adhesive interaction between eosinophils and pulmonary endothelial cells].	It has been reported that cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) antagonists reduce the accumulation of eosinophils in the asthmatic airway. However, the exact mechanism of this action remains to be established. In the present study, we examined whether a CysLT antagonist modifies the adhesive interaction between blood eosinophils and endothelial cells. Pranlukast hydrate, a CysLT antagonist, blocked the chemotactic response and adhesion of eosinophils induced by LTD4. On the other hand, pranlukast did not modify the eosinophil spontaneous adhesion to the resting or IL-4 plus TNF-alpha-stimulated pulmonary endothelial cells. Similarly, pranlukast did not modulate IL-5- or FMLP-activated eosinophil adhesion to the resting endothelial cells. Finally, pranlukast did not modify the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells stimulated with endothelial activating cytokines. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of CysLT antagonist on eosinophil accumulation in the asthmatic airways involves mechanisms other than the adhesive interaction between eosinophils and endothelial cells.
17203585	Differential expression of glycans in the hippocampus of rats trained on an inhibitory learning paradigm.	The glycan chains of glycoconjugates play important roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. In the CNS, previous studies on learning and memory suggest the importance of oligosaccharides attached to glycoconjugates in the modulation of synaptic connections. We studied the hippocampal glycan distribution of rats subject to an inhibitory avoidance task. The expression of glycans was examined by lectin-histochemistry using Vicia villosa lectin (VVL) for terminal alpha/beta N-acetylgalactosamine (alpha/beta GalNAc); Galanthus nivalus lectin (GNL) for terminal mannose alpha-1,3 (Man alpha-1,3); Peanut agglutinin (PNA) for galactose beta-1,3N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal beta-1,3 GalNAc); Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL) for galactose beta-1,4 N-acetylglucosamine (Gal beta-1,4 GlcNAc); Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) for sialic acid alpha-2.6 galactose (SA alpha-2,6 Gal); Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL II) for sialic acid alpha-2,3 (SA alpha-2,3); Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) for terminal N-acetylglucosamine with/ without sialic acid (GlcNAc wo SA); succynilated WGA (sWGA) for terminal N-acetylglucosamine without sialic acid (terminal GlcNAc without SA); Griffonia simplicifolia lectin II (GSL II) for terminal alpha/beta N-acetylglucosamine (alpha/beta GlcNAc terminal); and Lotus tetragonolobus lectin (LTL) alpha-fucose. Two groups of 10 animals were examined: non-trained (Control) and Trained rats. ECL, sWGA and GSL II were negative for both groups in all the hippocampal subfields studied. For both groups, VVL was negative in CA4 and granular cells of the Dentate Gyrus (DG) and LTL was negative in the CA4 subfield. Expression of alpha/beta GalNAc, alpha-fucose and GlcNAc in other hippocampal subflields was positive, with no differences between groups. However, expression of Man alpha-1,3 was significantly higher in the CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4 subfields in the Trained group. On the other hand, expression of Gal beta-1,3 GalNAc was significantly low in CA4 and DG in the Trained group. In conclusion, the results here presented indicate that the exposure of rats to an associative behavioral paradigm related to declarative memory, involves some regulatory mechanism/s for the differential patterns of glycan expression.
23570999	In vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory potential of pentahydroxy-pregn-14-ol, 20-one-β-d-thevetopyranoside in rats.	Polyhydroxy pregnane glycoside (PPG), a steroidal glycoside was isolated from Wattakaka volubilis Linn. (Stap.f.). PPG was evaluated for in vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory activity using acute inflammation and chronic model of inflammation in rats and LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. PPG seemed to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity in the studied models. PPG at dose level of both 5 and 10mg/kg significantly reduced the edema induced by the carrageenan in acute model of inflammation. It also showed significant anti-proliferative effect (dry pellet weight basis) in chronic model of inflammation. Cellular content of granuloma was measured by assaying activity of N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG) and total nucleic acid content. PPG at 5 and 10mg/kg significantly suppressed the cellular infiltration measured by total nucleic acid content. In contrast, NAG activity decreased over a period of 10 days resulting in inhibition of granuloma weight gain. PPG had a more effective response than the reference drug diclofenac sodium in both the models of inflammation. Wattakaka volubilis steroidal glycoside mixture (WVSM) and PPG (1-50μM) significantly inhibited the COX-2 and iNOS enzymes resulting in low levels of PGE2 and NO in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Hence the study supports the traditional use of Wattakaka volubilis and its constituent PPG in treatment of inflammatory disorders.
16970975	Non-enzymatic interactions of glyoxylate with lysine, arginine, and glucosamine: a study of advanced non-enzymatic glycation like compounds.	Glyoxylate is a 2 carbon aldo acid that is formed in hepatic tissue from glycolate. Once formed, the molecule can be converted to glycine by alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT). In defects of AGAT, glyoxylate is transformed to oxalate, resulting in high levels of oxalate in the body. The objective of this study was 2-fold. First, it was to determine, if akin to D-glucose, D-fructose or DL-glyceraldehyde, glyoxylate was susceptible to non-enzymatic attack by amino containing molecules such as lysine, arginine or glucosamine. Second, if by virtue of its molecular structure and size, glyoxylate was as reactive a reagent in non-enzymatic reactions as DL-glyceraldehyde; i.e., a glycose that we previously demonstrated to be a more effective glycating agent than D-glucose or D-fructose. Using capillary electrophoresis (CE), high performance liquid chromatography and UV and fluorescence spectroscopy, glyoxylate was found to be a highly reactive precursor of advanced glycation like end products (AGLEs) and a more effective promoter of non-enzymatic end products than D-glucose, D-fructose or DL-glyceraldehyde.
12057823	Serotonin transporter polymorphisms and measures of impulsivity, aggression, and sensation seeking among African-American cocaine-dependent individuals.	Considerable evidence indicates that serotonergic mechanisms, particularly the serotonin transporter (5HTT), may mediate central effects of cocaine and may also be involved in impulsive and aggressive behavior. We investigated whether polymorphisms in the 5HTT gene were related to traits of impulsivity, sensation seeking, and aggression among cocaine abusers. Standardized measures of these personality traits were obtained in a sample of 105 severely affected cocaine-dependent African-American subjects and 44 African-American controls. Two polymorphisms of the 5HTT gene were examined involving the 5' promoter (5HTTLPR) region and a 17 base pair variable-number-tandem-repeat (VNTR) marker among cocaine patients. No significant relationships were observed between polymorphic variants of the 5HTTLPR and VNTR regions and scores on any of the trait measures. Similarly, demographic variables and measures of severity of substance use and depression were unrelated to allele frequencies or genotype distributions of the variants among cocaine patients. As expected, cocaine patients scored significantly higher on total scores of impulsivity, aggression, and sensation seeking compared to controls. The findings do not seem to support an association between these polymorphisms in the 5HTT gene and impulsive-aggressive traits among cocaine-dependent African-American individuals.
23640471	Free volume in ionic liquids: a connection of experimentally accessible observables from PALS and PVT experiments with the molecular structure from XRD data.	In the current work, free volume concepts, primarily applied to glass formers in the literature, were transferred to ionic liquids (ILs). A series of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C4MIM](+)) based ILs was investigated by Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS). The phase transition and dynamic properties of the ILs [C4MIM][X] with [X](-) = [Cl](-), [BF4](-), [PF6](-), [OTf](-), [NTf2](-) and [B(hfip)4](-) were reported recently (Yu et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2012, 14, 6856-6868). In this subsequent work, attention was paid to the connection of the free volume from PALS (here the mean hole volume, 〈vh〉) with the molecular structure, represented by volumes derived from X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. These were the scaled molecular volume Vm,scaled and the van der Waals volume Vvdw. Linear correlations of 〈vh〉 at the "knee" temperature (〈vh〉(Tk)) with Vm,scaled and Vvdw gave good results for the [C4MIM](+) series. Further relationships between volumes from XRD data with the occupied volume Vocc determined from PALS/PVT (Pressure Volume Temperature) measurements and from Sanchez-Lacombe Equation of State (SL-EOS) fits were elaborated (Vocc(SL-EOS) ≈ 1.63 Vvdw, R(2) = 0.981 and Vocc(SL-EOS) ≈ 1.12 Vm,scaled, R(2) = 0.980). Finally, the usability of Vm,scaled was justified in terms of the Cohen-Turnbull (CT) free volume theory. Empirical CT type plots of viscosity and electrical conductivity showed a systematic increase in the critical free volume with molecular size. Such correlations allow descriptions of IL properties with the easily accessible quantity Vm,scaled within the context of the free volume.
11566608	Modulation of epidermal growth factor receptor in endocrine-resistant, oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.	There is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating that growth factor networks are highly interactive with oestrogen receptor (ER) signalling in the control of breast cancer growth. As such, tumour responses to anti- hormones are likely to be a composite of the ER and growth factor inhibitory activity of these agents. The current article examines the modulation of growth factor networks during endocrine response, and presents in vitro and clinical evidence that epidermal growth factor receptor signalling, maintained in either an ER-dependent or -independent manner, is critical to anti- hormonal-resistant breast cancer cell growth. The considerable potential of the epidermal growth factor receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ZD 1839 (Iressa; AstraZeneca) to efficiently treat, and perhaps even prevent, endocrine-resistant breast cancer is highlighted.
23002087	Arterial stiffness is inversely related to plasma adiponectin levels in young normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes.	OBJECTIVE This study investigated the association between arterial stiffness and plasma adiponectin in patients with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes who were up to age 40 years. Subjects on statins with macrovascular disease or overt nephropathy were excluded. Large artery stiffness was assessed by measurement of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), whereas plasma adiponectin was measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS Data from 80 patients (age 27.1 ± 6.1 years, BMI 24.2 ± 3.1 kg/m(2), HbA(1c) 7.5 ± 1.6%, 39 men, adiponectin 13.9 ± 6.7 μg/mL, and PWV 5.6 ± 0.9 m/s) were analyzed. Log adiponectin inversely correlated with age-adjusted PWV (r = -0.291, P = 0.009) and waist circumference (r = -0.427, P < 0.001). In a fully adjusted model, age, expiration/inspiration index, and log adiponectin were independently associated with PWV, explaining 39.6% of its variance. CONCLUSIONS Arterial stiffness is inversely related to adiponectin concentration in young patients with type 1 diabetes without major complications.
16719808	NMDA receptors are not alone: dynamic regulation of NMDA receptor structure and function by neuregulins and transient cholesterol-rich membrane domains leads to disease-specific nuances of glutamate-signalling.	Glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA-) subtype are tetrameric allosteric and ligand-gated calcium channels. They are modulated by a variety of endogenous ligands and ions and play a pivotal role in memory-related signal transduction due to a voltage-dependent block by magnesium, which makes them Hebbian coincidence detectors. On the structural level NMDA receptors have an enormous flexibility due to seven genes (NR1, NR2A-D and NR3A-B), alternative splicing, RNA-editing and extensive posttranslational modifications, like phosphorylation and glycosylation. NMDA receptors are thought to be responsible for excitotoxicity and subsequent downstream events like neuroinflammation and apoptosis and thus have been implicated in many important human pathologies, ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson' disease, depression, epilepsy, trauma and stroke to schizophrenia. This fundamental significance of NMDA receptor-related excitotoxicity is discussed in the context of the developing clinical success of Memantine, but moreover set into relation to various proteomic and genetic markers of said diseases. The very complex localisational and functional regulation of NMDA receptors appears to be dependent on neuregulins and receptor tyrosine kinases in cholesterol-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts), calcium-related mitochondrial feedback-loops and subsynaptic structural elements like PSD-95 (post-synaptic density protein of 95 kD). The flexibility and multitude of interaction partners and possibilities of these highly dynamic molecular systems are discussed in terms of drug development strategies, in particular comparing high affinity and sub-type specific ligands to currently successful or promising therapies.
23582273	Synthesis and antitumor activity of 1,3,4-oxadiazole possessing 1,4-benzodioxan moiety as a novel class of potent methionine aminopeptidase type II inhibitors.	A series of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives containing 1,4-benzodioxan moiety (7a-7q) have been designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antitumor activity. Most of the synthesized compounds were proved to have potent antitumor activity and low toxicity. Among them, compound 7a showed the most potent biological activity against Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells, which was comparable to the positive control. The results of apoptosis and flow cytometry (FCM) demonstrated that compound 7a induce cell apoptosis by the inhibition of MetAP2 pathway. Molecular docking was performed to position compound 7a into MetAP2 binding site in order to explore the potential target.
23485402	Therapeutic effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxin A: Potent blockade of autonomic transmission by targeted cleavage of only the pertinent SNAP-25.	In search of a basis for the impressive potency of an endoprotease that cleaves SNAP-25, botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A), in treating numerous diseases due to hyper-active autonomic nerves, truncation of its target and inhibition of neurotransmission were studied in rat sympathetic neurons. Tetrodotoxin-sensitive spontaneous cholinergic neurotransmission was blocked >80% by 1 pM BoNT/A despite cleaving <20% of the SNAP-25. A maximum cleavage of ∼60% SNAP-25 could be achieved with >1 nM BoNT/A, despite an absence of non-cleavable SNAP-25 in the detergent-solubilised neurons. In contrast, BoNT/E (100 nM) truncated nearly all the SNAP-25 in the intact cells, but was unable to block neurotransmission at low concentrations like BoNT/A. Chimeras created by inserting the acceptor-binding HC domain of BoNT/A into BoNT/E still cleaved all the SNAP-25, indicating ubiquitous expression of BoNT/A acceptors. Accordingly, SV2 and SNAP-25 were found to be co-expressed and broadly co-localised in neurons, but absent from non-neuronal cells. On the other hand, partial cleavage by the BoNT/A protease persisted upon replacing its HC with counterparts from BoNT/E or BoNT/B. Moreover, limited cleavage of SNAP-25 was conferred onto the protease from BoNT/E when fused to the N-terminus of BoNT/A. Thus, the BoNT/A protease is uniquely well-adapted for selectively inactivating the SNAP-25 directly involved in neurotransmission; this together with the toxin's acceptor and its target being localised on the peri-somatic boutons likely contribute to its exceptional therapeutic utility in the clinic.
2879901	Receptor-mediated pharmacodynamics of prednisolone in the rat.	A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model describing receptor-mediated effects of prednisolone is presented. The basis of the model is the generally accepted mechanism of action of steroid hormones in which corticosteroids bind to cytosolic receptors forming steroid-receptor complexes, which are activated and translocated into the nucleus. There the complexes associate with specific DNA sequences and modulate the rate of transcription of DNA into specific RNAs that code for the synthesis of proteins that elicit biological responses. Prednisolone, 5 or 50 mg/kg, was administered intravenously to adrenalectomized rats. Total plasma, free plasma, CBG-free plasma, and liver prednisolone concentrations were measured simultaneously with free hepatic cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor concentrations and tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) activity of the liver as a function of time. The association/dissociation kinetics of prednisolone binding to the glucocorticoid receptor were measured separately in vitro at 37 degrees C. Total plasma, free plasma, and CBG-free plasma prednisolone concentrations could be used equally well in the model to account for the time course of receptor concentrations and TAT activity. However, use of liver steroid concentrations resulted in an overestimation of receptor depletion. Steroid concentrations in plasma increased 20 to 30-fold with a tenfold increase in dose, but receptor occupancy and TAT activity over time increased about threefold. While prednisolone pharmacokinetics were dose-dependent, parameters describing receptor kinetics and TAT activity were constant at each prednisolone dose. The major determinants of receptor-mediated glucocorticoid activity are confirmed to be the availability of the receptor, drug-receptor dissociation rate, and corticosteroid persistence in the biophase.
23295224	Biocatalytic production of alpha-hydroxy ketones and vicinal diols by yeast and human aldo-keto reductases.	The α-hydroxy ketones are used as building blocks for compounds of pharmaceutical interest (such as antidepressants, HIV-protease inhibitors and antitumorals). They can be obtained by the action of enzymes or whole cells on selected substrates, such as diketones. We have studied the enantiospecificities of several fungal (AKR3C1, AKR5F and AKR5G) and human (AKR1B1 and AKR1B10) aldo-keto reductases in the production of α-hydroxy ketones and diols from vicinal diketones. The reactions have been carried out with pure enzymes and with an NADPH-regenerating system consisting of glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. To ascertain the regio and stereoselectivity of the reduction reactions catalyzed by the AKRs, we have separated and characterized the reaction products by means of a gas chromatograph equipped with a chiral column and coupled to a mass spectrometer as a detector. According to the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, the AKRs studied can be divided in two groups: one of them showed preference for the reduction of the proximal keto group, resulting in the S-enantiomer of the corresponding α-hydroxy ketones. The other group favored the reduction of the distal keto group and yielded the corresponding R-enantiomer. Three of the AKRs used (AKR1B1, AKR1B10 and AKR3C1) could produce 2,3-butanediol from acetoin. We have explored the structure/function relationships in the reactivity between several yeast and human AKRs and various diketones and acetoin. In addition, we have demonstrated the utility of these AKRs in the synthesis of selected α-hydroxy ketones and diols.
17592724	Hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative stress disrupts calcium binding on calmodulin: more evidence for oxidative stress in vitiligo.	Patients with acute vitiligo have low epidermal catalase expression/activities and accumulate 10(-3) M H(2)O(2). One consequence of this severe oxidative stress is an altered calcium homeostasis in epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes. Here, we show decreased epidermal calmodulin expression in acute vitiligo. Since 10(-3)M H(2)O(2) oxidises methionine and tryptophan residues in proteins, we examined calcium binding to calmodulin in the presence and absence of H(2)O(2) utilising (45)calcium. The results showed that all four calcium atoms exchanged per molecule of calmodulin. Since oxidised calmodulin looses its ability to activate calcium ATPase, enzyme activities were followed in full skin biopsies from lesional skin of patients with acute vitiligo (n=6) and healthy controls (n=6). The results yielded a 4-fold decrease of ATPase activities in the patients. Computer simulation of native and oxidised calmodulin confirmed the loss of all four calcium ions from their specific EF-hand domains. Taken together H(2)O(2)-mediated oxidation affects calcium binding in calmodulin leading to perturbed calcium homeostasis and perturbed l-phenylalanine-uptake in the epidermis of acute vitiligo.
23478802	Benzoquinone Reveals a Cysteine-Dependent Desensitization Mechanism of TRPA1.	The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) nonselective cation channel has a conserved function as a noxious chemical sensor throughout much of Metazoa. Electrophilic chemicals activate both insect and vertebrate TRPA1 via covalent modification of cysteine residues in the amino-terminal region. Although naturally occurring electrophilic plant compounds, such as mustard oil and cinnamaldehyde, are TRPA1 agonists, it is unknown whether arthropod-produced electrophiles activate mammalian TRPA1. We characterized the effects of the electrophilic arthropod defensive compound para-benzoquinone (pBQN) on the human TRPA1 channel. We used whole-cell recordings of human embryonic kidney cells heterologously expressing either wild-type TRPA1 or TRPA1 with three serine-substituted cysteines crucial for electrophile activation (C621S, C641S, C665S). We found that pBQN activates TRPA1 starting at 10 nM and peaking at 300 nM; higher concentrations caused rapid activation followed by a fast decline. Activation by pBQN required reactivity with cysteine residues, but ones that are distinct from those previously reported to be the key targets of electrophiles. The current reduction we found at higher pBQN concentrations was a cysteine-dependent desensitization of TRPA1, and did not require prior activation. The cysteines required for desensitization are not accessible to all electrophiles as iodoacetamide and internally applied 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanesulfonate failed to cause desensitization (despite large activation). Interestingly, following pBQN desensitization, wild-type TRPA1 had dramatically reduced response to the nonelectrophile agonist carvacrol, whereas the triple cysteine mutant TRPA1 retained its full response. Our results suggest that modification of multiple cysteine residues by electrophilic compounds can generate both activation and desensitization of the TRPA1 channel.
23567241	Comparative study on transcriptional activity of 17 parabens mediated by estrogen receptor α and β and androgen receptor.	The structure-activity relationships of parabens which are widely used as preservatives for transcriptional activities mediated by human estrogen receptor α (hERα), hERβ and androgen receptor (hAR) were investigated. Fourteen of 17 parabens exhibited hERα and/or hERβ agonistic activity at concentrations of ⩽1×10(-5)M, whereas none of the 17 parabens showed AR agonistic or antagonistic activity. Among 12 parabens with linear alkyl chains ranging in length from C1 to C12, heptylparaben (C7) and pentylparaben (C5) showed the most potent ERα and ERβ agonistic activity in the order of 10(-7)M and 10(-8)M, respectively, and the activities decreased in a stepwise manner as the alkyl chain was shortened to C1 or lengthened to C12. Most parabens showing estrogenic activity exhibited ERβ-agonistic activity at lower concentrations than those inducing ERα-agonistic activity. The estrogenic activity of butylparaben was markedly decreased by incubation with rat liver microsomes, and the decrease of activity was blocked by a carboxylesterase inhibitor. These results indicate that parabens are selective agonists for ERβ over ERα; their interactions with ERα/β are dependent on the size and bulkiness of the alkyl groups; and they are metabolized by carboxylesterases, leading to attenuation of their estrogenic activity.
23046389	Interspecies variation in the metabolism of zoniporide by aldehyde oxidase.	1. Aldehyde oxidase (AO) is a cytosolic enzyme that contributes to the Phase I metabolism of xenobiotics in human and preclinical species. 2. Current studies explored in vitro metabolism of zoniporide in various animal species and humans using S9 fractions. The animal species included commonly used pharmacology and toxicology models and domestic animals such as the cat, cow or bull, pig and horse. 3. In addition, gender and strain differences in some species were also explored. 4. All animals except the dog and cat converted zoniporide to 2-oxozoniporide (M1). 5. Michael-Menten kinetic studies were conducted in species that turned over zoniporide to M1. 6. Marked differences in KM, Vmax and Clint were observed in the oxidation of zoniporide. 7. Although the KM and Vmax of zoniporide oxidation in male and female human S9 was similar, some gender difference was observed in animals especially, in Vmax. 8. The domestic animals also showed marked species differences in the AO activity and affinity toward zoniporide.
23415228	A genetic program promotes C. elegans longevity at cold temperatures via a thermosensitive TRP channel.	Both poikilotherms and homeotherms live longer at lower body temperatures, highlighting a general role of temperature reduction in lifespan extension. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One prominent model is that cold temperatures reduce the rate of chemical reactions, thereby slowing the rate of aging. This view suggests that cold-dependent lifespan extension is simply a passive thermodynamic process. Here, we challenge this view in C. elegans by showing that genetic programs actively promote longevity at cold temperatures. We find that TRPA-1, a cold-sensitive TRP channel, detects temperature drop in the environment to extend lifespan. This effect requires cold-induced, TRPA-1-mediated calcium influx and a calcium-sensitive PKC that signals to the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. Human TRPA1 can functionally substitute for worm TRPA-1 in promoting longevity. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized function for TRP channels, link calcium signaling to longevity, and, importantly, demonstrate that genetic programs contribute to lifespan extension at cold temperatures.
10193665	Pharmacological profile of neuroleptics at human monoamine transporters.	Using radioligand binding techniques, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)) for 37 neuroleptics and one metabolite of a neuroleptic (haloperidol metabolite) for the human serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters with [3H]imipramine, [3H]nisoxetine, and [3H]WIN35428, respectively. Among neuroleptics, the four most potent compounds at the human serotonin transporter were triflupromazine, fluperlapine, chlorpromazine, and ziprasidone (K(D) 24-39 nM); and at the norepinephrine transporter, chlorpromazine, zotepine, chlorprothixene, and promazine (K(D) 19-25 nM). At the human dopamine transporter, only pimozide (K(D) = 69+/-3) ziprasidone (K(D) = 76+/-5) had notable potency. These data may be useful in predicting therapeutic and adverse effects, including drug interactions of neuroleptics.
10929089	Effects of the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase 1 or 2 or 5-lipoxygenase on the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis induced by interleukin-1beta in the male Rat.	The limited entry of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) into the central nervous system has led to the hypothesis that IL-1beta acts, through IL-1beta receptors located notably on endothelial cells, on the release of prostaglandins which in turn stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. We used cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitors, before the injection of IL-1beta, to explore the role of arachidonic acid metabolic pathways on HPA axis activation. Adult male rats were i.m injected 20 min before i.p injection of IL-1beta, with (i): a COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor (ketoprofen); (ii) a COX-2 selective inhibitor (NS 398); or (iii) a 5-LOX inhibitor (BW A4C). Following this, rats were killed 90 min after i.p. IL-1beta injection and analysis for plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone concentrations and determination of anterior pituitary pro-opio melanocortin (POMC) gene transcription was conducted. Administration of the COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor led to a complete blockage of ACTH and corticosterone secretion and POMC gene transcription. The COX-2 inhibitor led to a complete blockade of ACTH secretion and POMC gene transcription but had no effect on corticosterone secretion. The 5-LOX inhibitor had no significant effect on any parameter. These results demonstrate the crucial role of eicosanoid pathways in mediating the stimulation of the HPA axis induced by IL-1beta. Moreover, we found a clear dissociation of the effect of the blockage of COXs upon ACTH and corticosterone secretion, suggesting that IL-1beta may act at the brain as well as at the adrenal cortex to stimulate the secretion of corticosterone.
23142325	The role of mitochondria and biotransformation in abamectin-induced cytotoxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes.	Abamectin (ABA), which belongs to the family of avermectins, is used as a parasiticide; however, ABA poisoning can impair liver function. In a previous study using isolated rat liver mitochondria, we observed that ABA inhibited the activity of adenine nucleotide translocator and FoF1-ATPase. The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of ABA toxicity in isolated rat hepatocytes and to evaluate whether this effect is dependent on its metabolism. The toxicity of ABA was assessed by monitoring oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular ATP concentration, cell viability, intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, release of cytochrome c, caspase 3 activity and necrotic cell death. ABA reduces cellular respiration in cells energized with glutamate and malate or succinate. The hepatocytes that were previously incubated with proadifen, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, are more sensitive to the compound as observed by a rapid decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by reductions in ATP concentration and cell viability and a disruption of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis followed by necrosis. Our results indicate that ABA biotransformation reduces its toxicity, and its toxic action is related to the inhibition of mitochondrial activity, which leads to decreased synthesis of ATP followed by cell death.
22940283	Relation between dynamics, activity and thermal stability within the cholinesterase family.	Incoherent neutron scattering is one of the most powerful tools for studying dynamics in biological matter. Using the cold neutron backscattering spectrometer IN16 at the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL, Grenoble, France), temperature dependence of cholinesterases' dynamics (human butyrylcholinesterase from plasma: hBChE; recombinant human acetylcholinesterase: hAChE and recombinant mouse acetylcholinesterase: mAChE) was examined using elastic incoherent neutron scattering (EINS). The dynamics was characterized by the averaged atomic mean square displacement (MSD), associated with the sample flexibility at a given temperature. We found MSD values of hAChE above the dynamical transition temperature (around 200K) larger than for mAChE and hBChE, implying that hAChE is more flexible than the other ChEs. Activation energies for thermodynamical transition were extracted through the frequency window model (FWM) (Becker et al. 2004) [1] and turned out to increase from hBChE to mAChE and finally to hAChE, inversely to the MSDs relations. Between 280 and 316K, catalytic studies of these enzymes were carried out using thiocholine esters: at the same temperature, the hAChE activity was systematically higher than the mAChE or hBChE ones. Our results thus suggest a strong correlation between dynamics and activity within the ChE family. We also studied and compared the ChEs thermal inactivation kinetics. Here, no direct correlation with the dynamics was observed, thus suggesting that relations between enzyme dynamics and catalytic stability are more complex. Finally, the possible relation between flexibility and protein ability to grow in crystals is discussed.
23109425	Systematic identification of functional residues in mammalian histone H2AX.	The histone variant H2AX is a principal component of chromatin involved in the detection, signaling, and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). H2AX is thought to operate primarily through its C-terminal S139 phosphorylation, which mediates the recruitment of DNA damage response (DDR) factors to chromatin at DSB sites. Here, we describe a comprehensive screen of 67 residues in H2AX to determine their contributions to H2AX functions. Our analysis revealed that H2AX is both sumoylated and ubiquitylated. Individual residues defective for sumoylation, ubiquitylation, and S139 phosphorylation in untreated and damaged cells were identified. Specifically, we identified an acidic triad region in both H2A and H2AX that is required in cis for their ubiquitylation. We also report the characterization of a human H2AX knockout cell line, which exhibits DDR defects, including p53 activation, following DNA damage. Collectively, this work constitutes the first genetic complementation system for a histone in human cells. Finally, our data reveal new roles for several residues in H2AX and define distinct functions for H2AX in human cells.
10665814	Determinants of voltage-dependent inactivation affect Mibefradil block of calcium channels.	The voltage gated calcium channel family is a major target for a range of therapeutic drugs. Mibefradil (Ro 40-5967) belongs to a new chemical class of these molecules which differs from other Ca2+ antagonists by its ability to potently block T-type Ca2+ channels. However, this molecule has also been shown to inhibit other Ca2+ channel subtypes. To further analyze the mechanism governing the Ca2+ channel-Mibefradil interaction, we examined the effect of Mibefradil on various recombinant Ca2+ channels expressed in mammalian cells from their cloned cDNAs, using Ca2+ as the permeant ion at physiological concentration. Expression of alpha1A, alpha1C, and alpha1E in tsA 201 cells resulted in Ca2+ currents with functional characteristics closely related to those of their native counterparts. Mibefradil blocked alpha1A and alpha1E with a Kd comparable to that reported for T-type channels, but had a lower affinity (approximately 30-fold) for alpha1C. For each channel, inhibition by Mibefradil was consistent with high-affinity binding to the inactivated state. Modulation of the voltage-dependent inactivation properties by the nature of the coexpressed beta subunit or the alpha1 splice variant altered block at the Mibefradil receptor site. Therefore, we conclude that the tissue and sub-cellular localization of calcium channel subunits as well as their specific associations are essential parameters to understand the in vivo effects of Mibefradil.
23557706	mTOR Regulates Nox4-Mediated Podocyte Depletion in Diabetic Renal Injury.	Podocyte apoptosis is a critical mechanism for excessive loss of urinary albumin that eventuates in kidney fibrosis. Pharmacological doses of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reduce albuminura in diabetes. We explored the hypothesis that mTOR mediates podocyte injury in diabetes. High glucose (HG) induces apoptosis of podocytes, inhibits AMPK activation, inactivates tuberin and activates mTOR. HG also increases the levels of Nox4 and Nox1 and NADPH oxidase activity. Inhibition of mTOR by low dose rapamycin decreases HG-induced Nox4 and Nox1, NADPH oxidase activity and podocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of mTOR had no effect on AMPK or tuberin phosphorylation indicating that mTOR is downstream of these signaling molecules. In isolated glomeruli of OVE26 mice, there is similar decrease in the activation of AMPK and tuberin and activation of mTOR with increase in Nox4 and NADPH oxidase activity. Inhibition of mTOR by small dose of rapamycin reduces podocyte apoptosis, attenuates glomerular injury and albuminuria. Our data provide evidence for a novel function of mTOR in Nox4-derived ROS generation and podocyte apoptosis that contributes to urinary albumin excretion in type 1 diabetes. Thus mTOR and or NADPH oxidase inhibition may represent a therapeutic modality of diabetic kidney disease.
17500228	[Characteristics of A-interferon-generated dendritic cells in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis].	The phenotype of the dendritic cells (DC) generated from the adhesion fraction of mononuclear cells in the presence of GM-CSF and alpha-interferon was studied in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Despite the absence of significant differences in the count of mature CD83+DCs in the groups of patients (n = 38) and healthy donors (n = 30), elevated CD14(+)-monocyte levels and few activated CD25(+)-DCs were indicative of the impaired process of DC maturation/generation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly in a subgroup of patients with a low T-cell proliferative response against PPD (PPD-anergy, n = 10). The patients with tuberculosis showed the lower relative levels of CD11c(-)-CD123(+)-DC and the normal levels of myeloid CD11c(+)D123(-)DCs. However, in patients with PPD-anergy, the content of myeloid CD11c(+)CD123(-)-DCs was significantly higher than that in PPD-reactive patients. Moreover, the patients with PPD-anergy were characterized by the elevated peripheral blood levels of CD14+CD16(+)-monocytes, which was associated with the high suppressive activity of monocytes (r(s) = 0.53; p < 0.05). The impaired process of DC generation/maturation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis is believed to be associated with the changes in the phenotypic and functional properties of monocytes and to be a cause of an inadequate antigen-specific response in tuberculous infection.
17409318	Competition between 24:5n-3 and ALA for Delta 6 desaturase may limit the accumulation of DHA in HepG2 cell membranes.	The use of Delta 6 desaturase (D6D) twice in the conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) suggests that this enzyme may play a key regulatory role in the synthesis and accumulation of DHA from ALA. We examined this using an in vitro model of fatty acid metabolism to measure the accumulation of the long-chain metabolites of ALA in HepG2 cell phospholipids. The accumulation of ALA, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3), and 24:5n-3 in cell phospholipids was linearly related to the concentration of supplemented ALA over the range tested (1.8-72 microM). The accumulation of the post-D6D products of 22:5n-3, 24:6n-3 and DHA, in cell phospholipids was saturated at concentrations of >18 microM ALA. Supplementation of HepG2 cells with preformed DHA revealed that, although the accumulation of DHA in cell phospholipids approached saturation, the level of DHA in cell phospholipids was significantly greater compared with the accumulation of DHA from ALA, indicating that the accumulation of DHA from ALA was not limited by incorporation. The parallel pattern of accumulation of 24:6n-3 and DHA in response to increasing concentrations of ALA suggests that the competition between 24:5n-3 and ALA for D6D may contribute to the limited accumulation of DHA in cell membranes.
18703043	Agonist-directed trafficking of signalling at serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C-VSV receptors mediated Gq/11 activation and calcium mobilisation in CHO cells.	Several examples of agonist-directed trafficking of receptor signalling at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors have been reported that involve independent downstream transduction pathways. We now report the functional selectivity of a series of chemically diverse agonists at human (h)5-HT2A, h5-HT2B and h5-HT2C-VSV by examining two related responses, the upstream activation of Gq/11 proteins in comparison with its associated cascade of calcium mobilisation. At the h5-HT2A receptor, d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the antiparkinsonian agents lisuride, bromocriptine and pergolide exhibit a higher potency for Gq/11 activation than calcium release in contrast with all the other tested ligands such as 5-HT, mCPP and BW723C86, that show an opposite preference of signalling pathway. Comparable observations are made at h5-HT2B and h5-HT2C-VSV receptors, suggesting a similar mechanism of functional selectivity for the three serotonin receptors. Interestingly, the non-hallucinogenic compound lisuride behaves as a partial agonist for both Gq/11 activation and calcium release at the three 5-HT2 receptors, in contrast with DOI, LSD, pergolide and bromocriptine, which are known to provoke hallucinations, and behave as more efficacious agonists. Hence, a functional selectivity for Gq/11 activation together with a threshold of efficacy at h5-HT2A (and possibly h5-HT2B and/or h5-HT2C-VSV) may contribute to hallucinogenic liability. Thus, our results extend the notion of agonist-directed trafficking of receptor signalling to all the 5-HT2-receptor family and indicate that measures of Gq/11 activation versus calcium release may be useful to identify more effective therapeutic drugs with limited side effects.
10196703	Mortality risk in men is associated with a common mutation in the methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR).	An elevated level of homocysteine in plasma is associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. A common ala-to-val mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) is associated with an elevated level of plasma homocysteine. We studied the possible detrimental effects of the MTHFR mutation on mortality. Within a population-based study in the city of Leiden, the Netherlands, we first compared the MTHFR genotype distribution among 365 elderly subjects aged 85 years and over born in Leiden, and 250 young subjects aged 18 to 40 years whose families originated from the same geographical region. Second, the complete cohort of 666 subjects aged 85 years and over was followed over a period of 10 years for all-cause and cause-specific mortality and stratified according to MTHFR genotype. The frequency of the MTHFR mutation was significantly lower in the elderly than in the young (0.30 and 0.36, respectively; P = 0.03). The difference in genotype distribution was only present in men. The estimated mortality risk up to 85 years in men carrying the vallval genotype was 3.7 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-10.9). Over the age of 85, mortality in men with the vallval genotype was increased 2.0-fold (95% CI, 1.1-3.9) and appeared to be attributable to cancer rather than cardiovascular causes of death. Among women aged 85 years and over, no deleterious effect of the MTHFR mutation was observed. In conclusion, the MTHFR mutation is associated with increased mortality in men in middle and old age, but not in women.
22945693	Methylation levels of sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) promoter in benign and malignant thyroid tumors with reduced NIS expression.	DNA methylation regulates gene expression. Aberrant methylation plays an important role in human tumorigenesis. We have previously detected reduced NIS mRNA expression in thyroid tumors as compared to non-tumor tissues. Thus, in this study we investigated whether the methylation of the CpG-island located in the NIS gene promoter was associated with reduced mRNA expression in thyroid tumors. Methylation levels of 30 pairs of samples from 10 benign and 20 malignant thyroid tumors (T) along with matched non-tumor (NT) areas were determined by semiquantitative methylation specific-PCR. NIS methylation was detected in all samples. Methylation levels and frequencies did not differ between the groups and were not associated with BRAF mutational status. Highest methylation levels and frequencies were detected in the 5' region of the CpG-island decreasing toward the 3' end. Intraindividual analysis (T versus NT) showed high tumor methylation levels in 40 % of the samples in the benign group and 30 % in the malignant group, associated with low NIS mRNA expression. No quantitative correlation was detected between methylation levels and mRNA expression in any the groups. The results of this study showed that methylation of NIS promoter is a very frequent event in both benign and malignant tumors as well as in their surrounding tissues, and characterized a non-homogeneous methylation pattern along the CpG island. Therefore, further investigations involving other sites that may be implicated in methylation regulation of NIS expression are warranted.
10561120	Decreased intracellular proteolysis correlates with the maintenance of a specific isoenzyme of cytochrome P-450.	The rates of intracellular protein degradation, of identically labelled populations of proteins, were compared in hepatocytes cultured at 37 degrees (on an adsorbed collagen layer) and in cells preserved on gelatin gels at 10 degrees C. The half-lives of the long-lived proteins were 35.4+/-8.6 h (N=4) and 692.9+/-216.9 h (N=4) respectively. Proteolysis was substantially decreased at 10 degrees C but the rate of decrease remained constant. Hepatocytes rapidly removed resorufin from the culture medium. The resorufin was not being conjugated or accumulated within the cells. Dicumarol, a potent inhibitor of quinone oxidoreductase, at high concentration (500 microm ) caused only a 72% decrease in the utilization of resorufin. The microsomal detoxifying enzyme, cytochrome P-450 1A1 remained at a constant level in the preserved hepatocyte monolayers. The results of this study strongly favour storing hepatocytes at 10 degrees C rather than at 4 degrees or 37 degrees C.
11470741	Cerivastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, inhibits the signaling pathways involved in the invasiveness and metastatic properties of highly invasive breast cancer cell lines: an in vitro study.	Cerivastatin is used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia to inhibit 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and thus prevent the synthesis of cholesterol precursors, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), responsible, respectively, for translocation of Ras and Rho to the cell membrane, a step required for their cell signaling, leading to cell proliferation and migration. Recently, it has been suggested that non lipid-related effects of statins could play a beneficial role in cancer therapy. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which statins inhibit cancer and the types of cancers which could benefit from this therapy. In MDA-MB-231 cells, an aggressive breast cancer cell line with spontaneous activation of Ras and NFkappaB and overexpression of RhoA, cerivastatin induced inhibition of both cell proliferation and invasion through Matrigel. This anti-proliferative effect was related to G(1)/S arrest due to an increase in p21(Waf1/Cip1). The anti-invasive effect was observed from 18 h and could be explained by RhoA delocalization from the cell membrane, resulting in disorganization of the actin fibers and disappearance of focal adhesion sites. The importance of RhoA inactivation in both these inhibitory effects was proved by their reversion by GGPP but not by FPP. Moreover, cerivastatin was also shown to induce inactivation of NFkappaB, in a RhoA inhibition-dependent manner, resulting in a decrease in urokinase and metalloproteinase-9 expression, two proteases involved in cell migration. The participation of Ras inactivation is considered a subsidiary mechanism for the effects of cerivastatin, as they were not rescued by FPP. Prolonged treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with high doses of cerivastatin induced a loss of cell attachment. Interestingly, the effect of cerivastatin was considerably lower on poorly invasive MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that cerivastatin inhibits cell signaling pathways involved in the invasiveness and metastatic properties of highly invasive cancers.
2512511	G protein dependent alterations in [125I]iodocyanopindolol and +/- cyanopindolol binding at 5-HT1B binding sites in rat brain membranes.	Several manipulations that affect G protein/receptor coupling also alter the binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) and [corrected] +/- cyanopindolol (+/- CYP) to rat brain 5-HT1B binding sites in radioligand binding assays. Inclusion of 5 mM MgSO4 in these assays results in a small but significant increase in the affinity of [125I]ICYP (from KD = 0.046 nM to KD = 0.037 nM). In contrast, 100 microM Gpp(NH)p, GTP, or GDP reduce [125I]ICYP affinity (KD = 0.056 nM with GTP) while ATP and GMP are less effective. +/- CYP affinity for 5-HT1B sites labeled by [3H]dihydroergotamine [( 3H]DE) also displays a small but significant reduction (from Ki = 1.4 nM to Ki = 3.5nM) by the inclusion of 100 microM GTP. Pre-treatment of the brain membranes with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in concentrations known to inactivate many G proteins reduces 5-HT1B specific binding of [125I]ICYP. The NEM induced reduction in [125I]ICYP binding can be reversed by reconstitution with purified exogenous G proteins (Go and Gi), demonstrating directly that high affinity binding of [125I]ICYP to 5-HT1B sites is dependent on G proteins. The effects of Mg2+ ion, guanine nucleotides, NEM and G protein reconstitution on [125I]ICYP and +/- CYP binding are all hallmarks of agonist binding to G protein linked receptors. The effect of GTP, however, is quantitatively much less for the binding of these pindolol derivatives than for the binding of 5-HT, a presumed full agonist at 5-HT1B sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
17387686	Inhibition of phosphatidylserine biosynthesis in developing rat brain by maternal exposure to ethanol.	Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), major acidic phospholipids in neuronal membranes, participate in important cell signaling processes. The PtdSer in brain is highly enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), and the DHA status or ethanol exposure has been shown to influence the PtdSer level. This study shows that ethanol exposure during prenatal and developmental period significantly attenuates microsomal PtdSer biosynthetic activities and reduces PtdSer, particularly 18:0, 22:6-PtdSer, in developing rat brain cortices. Brain microsomes were incubated with deuterium labeled exogenous substrates in vitro and the products formed were detected by reversed phase HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). These in vitro bioassays showed that 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl (18:0, 22:6) species is the best substrate for PtdSer synthesis from both phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). The PtdSer biosynthetic activity of brain, especially for 18:0, 22:6-PtdSer production, was hampered significantly by maternal exposure to ethanol. PtdSer levels were consistently reduced significantly in brain cortices of the pups from ethanol-exposed dams, due mainly to the depletion of 18:0, 22:6-PtdSer. The mRNA expression of PtdSer synthase 1 (PSS1) and PtdSer synthase 2 (PSS2) was not reduced by ethanol. Similarly, the PSS1 enzyme level did not change after ethanol exposure but PSS2 could not be probed with the antibody available currently. Degradation of PtdSer by mitochondrial PtdSer decarboxylation was not enhanced but also inhibited. Taken together, attenuated PtdSer biosynthetic activities are largely responsible for the PtdSer reduction observed in developing rat brains after maternal exposure to ethanol.
10567921	Functional significance of globotriaosyl ceramide in interferon-alpha(2)/type 1 interferon receptor-mediated antiviral activity.	The N-terminus of the type 1 interferon receptor subunit, IFNAR1, has high amino acid sequence similarity to the receptor binding B subunit of the Escherichia coli-derived verotoxin 1, VT1. The glycolipid, globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb(3): Gal alpha(1) --> 4 Gal beta 1 --> 4 Glu beta 1 --> 1 Cer) is the specific cell receptor for VT1. Gb(3)-deficient variant cells selected for VT resistance are cross-resistant to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)-mediated antiproliferative activity. The association of eIFNAR1 with Gal alpha 1 --> 4 Gal containing glycolipids has been previously shown to be important for the receptor-mediated IFN-alpha signal transduction for growth inhibition. The crucial role of Gb(3) for the signal transduction of IFN-alpha-mediated antiviral activity is now reported. IFN-alpha-mediated antiviral activity, nuclear translocation of activated Stat1, and increased expression of PKR were defective in Gb(3)-deficient vero mutant cells, although the surface expression of IFNAR1 was unaltered. The VT1B subunit was found to inhibit IFN-alpha-mediated antiviral activity, Stat1 nuclear translocation and PKR upregulation. Unlike VT1 cytotoxicity, IFN-alpha-induced Stat1 nuclear translocation was not inhibited when RME was prevented, suggesting that the accessory function of Gb(3) occurs at the plasma membrane. IFN-alpha antiviral activity was also studied in Gb(3)-positive MRC-5 cells, which are resistant to IFN-alpha growth inhibition, partially resistant to VT1 but still remain fully sensitive to IFN-alpha antiviral activity, and two astrocytoma cell lines expressing different Gb(3) fatty acid isoforms. In both systems, long chain fatty acid-containing Gb(3) isoforms, which are less effective to mediate VT1 cytotoxicity, were found to correlate with higher IFN-alpha-mediated antiviral activity. Inhibition of Gb(3) synthesis in toto prevented IFN-alpha antiviral activity in all cells. We propose that the long chain Gb(3) fatty isoforms preferentially remain in the plasma membrane, and by associating with IFNAR1, mediate IFN-alpha antiviral signaling, whereas short chain Gb(3) fatty acid isoforms are preferentially internalized to mediate VT1 cytotoxicity and IFNAR1-dependent IFN-alpha growth inhibition.
23536517	The protective effects of taurine on experimental acute pancreatitis in a rat model.	The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of taurine (Tau) on experimental acute pancreatitis (AP) in a rat model by measuring cytokines and oxidant stress markers.Forty rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham, AP, Tau and AP + Tau. AP was induced with sodium taurocholate. No treatment was given to the AP. All rats were killed 5 days later. Pancreatic tissues of rats and blood samples were obtained.Tau treatment significantly decreased serum amylase activity (p < 0.001), total injury score (p < 0.001), malondialdehyde levels (p < 0.001) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the Tau and AP + Tau groups in serum and pancreatic tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 levels (p = 1.000). Histopathologic scores in the AP + Tau and Tau groups were significantly lower compared with the AP group (both p < 0.001).These results showed that Tau reduces lipid peroxidation, amylase and MPO activities and the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines secondary to AP and also increases superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in rats with sodium taurocholate-induced AP. It also has a marked ameliorative effect at histopathologic lesions. With these effects, Tau protects the cells from oxidative damage, reduces inflammation and promotes regression of pancreatic damage.
10950934	Chromosomal localization, gene structure, and expression pattern of DDAH1: comparison with DDAH2 and implications for evolutionary origins.	Endogenously produced asymmetrically methylated arginine residues are competitive inhibitors of all three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) specifically hydrolyzes these asymmetrically methylated arginine residues to citrulline and methylamines. Previously we have proposed that regulation of asymmetric methylarginine concentration by DDAH may provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of NOS activity in vivo. Recently we reported the cloning of human DDAH and identified a novel human DDAH isoform (DDAH I and DDAH II, respectively). Here we report that the DDAH1 gene maps to chromosome 1p22 and confirm that DDAH2 maps to the MHC III region of chromosome 6p21.3. Extensive analysis of the distribution of DDAH1 and DDAH2 mRNA in 50 human tissues indicates differential expression of DDAH isoforms in brain regions, in immune cells, and during development. DDAH2 expression predominates in highly vascularized tissues that express the endothelial NOS isoform and in immune tissues that can express iNOS. Whereas DDAH2 is expressed at relatively high levels in all fetal tissues examined, DDAH1 expression varies little between fetal and adult tissues. The chromosomal localization of the DDAHs is consistent with gene duplication, and consistent with this, comparison of the gene structures indicates that the intron/exon organization is highly conserved. Phylogenetic analysis of DDAH sequences from diverse species suggests that DDAH gene duplication occurred prior to the emergence of bony fish some 400 million years ago. Overall the data suggest that DDAH2 may be the more ancient of the two genes.
17484506	Endometriosis: the way forward.	Endometriosis, a common cause of morbidity, affects 10% of women of reproductive age. In this review we focus on the new developments in pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment options, reviewing the literature published about this enigmatic disorder over the past three years. More specifically, new theories of the pathogenesis of the syndrome of Sampson and Cullen are discussed. The new era of genomics may characterize endometriosis and transform clinical management of the disease. Literature suggesting that endometriosis may have an environmental origin is reviewed. New approaches to medical therapy of endometriosis have been developed, including the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device, aromatase inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, angiogenesis inhibitors, selective estrogen and progesterone receptor modulators, and statins. Subfertility is another well-known result of endometriosis and often complex decisions must be made regarding management of the endometriosis patient who wishes to conceive. Laparoscopic surgery and assisted reproduction--with or without gonadotropin-releasing hormone-agonist treatment--are reviewed. Finally we speculate about new developments in the field of endometriosis in the coming three years.
23421517	Reversal effect of rosmarinic acid on multidrug resistance in SGC7901/Adr cell.	Multidrug resistance (MDR) has been a major problem in cancer chemotherapy. In this study, the aim was to explore the reversal effect and its potential mechanism of rosmarinic acid (RA) on SGC7901/Adr cells. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to investigate the reversal index of RA in SGC7901/Adr cell line. The intracellular accumulation of adriamycin, rhodamine123 (Rh123), and the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were assayed by flow cytometry. The influence of RA on the transcription of MDR1 gene was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that RA could reverse the MDR of SGC7901/Adr cells, increase the intracellular accumulation of Adr and Rh123, and decrease the transcription of MDR1 gene and the expression of P-gp in SGC7901/Adr cells. These results indicated that RA was a potential multidrug resistance-reversing agent and warranted further investigations.
23122078	Purification and characterization of membrane-bound polyphenoloxidase (mPPO) from Snake fruit [Salacca zalacca (Gaertn.) Voss].	Membrane-bound polyphenoloxidase (mPPO) an oxidative enzyme which is responsible for the undesirable browning reaction in Snake fruit (Salacca zalacca (Gaertn.) Voss) was investigated. The enzyme was extracted using a non-ionic detergent (Triton X-114), followed by temperature-induced phase partitioning technique which resulted in two separate layers (detergent-poor phase at the upper layer and detergent-rich phase at the lower layer). The upper detergent-poor phase extract was subsequently fractionated by 40-80% ammonium sulfate and chromatographed on HiTrap Phenyl Sepharose and Superdex 200 HR 10/30. The mPPO was purified to 14.1 folds with a recovery of 12.35%. A single prominent protein band appeared on native-PAGE and SDS-PAGE implying that the mPPO is a monomeric protein with estimated molecular weight of 38kDa. Characterization study showed that mPPO from Snake fruit was optimally active at pH 6.5, temperature 30°C and active towards diphenols as substrates. The K(m) and V(max) values were calculated to be 5.46 mM and 0.98 U/ml/min, respectively, when catechol was used as substrate. Among the chemical inhibitors tested, l-cysteine showed the best inhibitory effect, with an IC(50) of 1.3 ± 0.002 mM followed by ascorbic acid (1.5 ± 0.06 mM), glutathione (1.5 ± 0.07 mM), EDTA (100 ± 0.02 mM) and citric acid (186 ± 0.16 mM).
17092971	In vitro functional characteristics of dopamine D2 receptor partial agonists in second and third messenger-based assays of cloned human dopamine D2Long receptor signalling.	Aripiprazole, (+)terguride, OPC-4392 and (-)3-PPP have been classified as dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonists based largely on their activity in second messenger-based assays of dopamine D(2) receptor signalling. Nevertheless, signal transduction amplification might result in these compounds behaving as dopamine D(2) receptor full agonists at a more downstream level of signalling. We compared the intrinsic activity (E(max), expressed as a percentage of the maximal effect of dopamine) of aripiprazole, (+)terguride, OPC-4392 and (-)3-PPP using second (calcium (Ca(2+)) mobilization) and third (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) phosphoprotein expression) messenger readouts of cloned human dopamine D(2long) (hD(2L)) receptor signalling in CHO cells. These compounds were all less potent and displayed lower intrinsic activity in the Ca(2+) assay (aripiprazole = 24.3%, (+)terguride = 56.9%, OPC-4392 = 58.6% and (-)3-PPP = 75.1%), and aripiprazole (E(max) = 54.5%) displayed a substantially lower intrinsic activity than (+)terguride (E(max) = 92.3%), OPC-4392 (E(max) = 93.1%) and (-)3-PPP (E(max) = 101.1%) in the more downstream-based ERK2 phosphoprotein expression assay. These drug effects on Ca(2+) mobilization and ERK2 phosphoprotein expression were mediated through dopamine hD(2L) receptors, as they all were blocked by (-)raclopride, whereas (-)raclopride and other dopamine D(2) receptor antagonists (haloperidol, risperidone, ziprasidone, olanzapine, clozapine and quetiapine) were inactive on their own in both assays. These data are consistent with clinical evidence that only dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonists with a sufficiently low enough intrinsic activity will prove effective against the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and also highlight the importance of using downstream-based assays in the discovery of novel D(2) receptor partial agonist therapeutics.
22447684	Quercetin reduces high-fat diet-induced fat accumulation in the liver by regulating lipid metabolism genes.	To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of quercetin on the physiological effects of hyperlipidemia, we investigated its role in the prevention of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and found that it regulated hepatic gene expression related to lipid metabolism. Quercetin supplementation in mice significantly reduced the HFD-induced gains in body weight, liver weight, and white adipose tissue weight compared with the mice fed only with HFD. It also significantly reduced HFD-induced increases in serum lipids, including cholesterol, triglyceride, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS). Consistent with the reduced liver weight and white adipose tissue weight, hepatic lipid accumulation and the size of lipid droplets in the epididymal fat pads were also reduced by quercetin supplementation. To further investigate how quercetin may reduce obesity, we analyzed lipid metabolism-related genes in the liver. Quercetin supplementation altered expression profiles of several lipid metabolism-related genes, including Fnta, Pon1, Pparg, Aldh1b1, Apoa4, Abcg5, Gpam, Acaca, Cd36, Fdft1, and Fasn, relative to those in HFD control mice. The expression patterns of these genes observed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction were confirmed by immunoblot assays. Collectively, our results indicate that quercetin prevents HFD-induced obesity in C57B1/6 mice, and its anti-obesity effects may be related to the regulation of lipogenesis at the level of transcription.
12142814	Tyrosinemia I, a model for human diseases mediated by 2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases: hepatotoxin suppression by NTBC does not normalize hepatic collagen metabolism.	OBJECTIVES: Medical treatment of tyrosinemia I relies on the herbicide NTBC [Orfadin 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-cyclohexane-1,3-dione], an inhibitor of plant and mammalian 2-oxoacid-utilizing dioxygenases with a collective catalytic cycle ('HAG' mechanism). We hypothesize that NTBC-treated tyrosinemia I is a human model for the pathogenic role of two major enzymes in this class, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (4-HPPD; EC 1.13.11.27) and prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4-H; E.C. 1.14.11.2), essential for tyrosine and collagen metabolism, respectively. METHODS: In a patient with established tyrosinemia I, we monitored the in vivo activities of 4-HPPD and P4-H via five biomarkers before and during NTBC medication. Hypothesis testing at the molecular level was performed by computational modeling of NTBC binding to the crystal structure-derived active site of 4-HPPD, and then relating these findings to our experimental results and to known P4-H data. RESULTS: NTBC rapidly normalized the biomarkers for 4-HPPD activity. However, those for P4-H activity remained uniformly elevated after one hundred days on NTBC, the PIIINP biomarker even increasing above its grossly abnormal, initial level. This selective enzyme inhibition despite a collective catalytic cycle is attributed to the conformation of NTBC, which only fits the active site of 4-HPPD, as confirmed by its crystal structure. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of hepatic collagen formation, highly desirable in all fibrotic liver diseases, is not achieved by NTBC in tyrosinemia I. By establishing the molecular cause for this failure, our results also establish a rational approach to identify inhibitors that achieve that goal, either by joint 4-HPPD / P-4H inhibition, or by inhibition of only P-4H.
23370194	Synthesis, quantitative structure-activity relationship and biological evaluation of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives possessing diphenylamine moiety as potential anticancer agents.	Synthesis of 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole (2a-c), 3-substituted aminomethyl-5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2(3H)-thione (4a-m) and 2-substituted thio-5-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole (5a, b) had been described. All the synthesized derivatives were screened for anticancer activity against HT29 and MCF7 cancer cell lines using Sulfo-Rodamine B (SRB) standard method. Most of the tested compounds exploited potent antiproliferative activity against HT29 cancer cell line rather than MCF7 cancer cell line. Compounds 2a-c, 4f and 5a exhibited potent cytotoxicity (IC(50) 1.3-2.0 µM) and selectivity against HT29 cancer cell line. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study was applied to find a correlation between the experimental antiproliferative activities of the newly synthesized oxadiazole derivatives with their physicochemical parameter and topological index.
23639586	Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis of hepatotoxicity induced by triptolide in Wistar rats.	Triptolide (TP), a major component of TWHF, is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, nephritis and leprosy. However, its clinical use is limited by hepatotoxicity. To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of its hepatotoxic effects, hepatic gene expression profiles were analyzed. TP (1000 and 300μg/kg) was orally administered to Wistar rats for 14days. Current study indicated that female rats were more sensitive to TP-induced hepatotoxicity than males. Genome-wide microarray analyses identified 3329 differentially expressed genes in liver of female rats. Analyses of these genes identified over-represented functions associated with insulin signaling pathway, glucose metabolism, cell cycle, oxidative stress and apoptosis, which were consistent with the results of significant increase of Caspase-3 activity and reduction of serum glucose, GSH/GSSG ratio, glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities, liver glycogen. In addition, it was observed for the first time that glucocorticoids and IGF1 might get involved in TP-induced hepatotoxicity. These data suggest that TP treatment could alter the hepatic redox status, reduce serum glucose and induce hepatocyte apoptosis, consistent with the differential expression of genes involved in insulin signaling pathway, glucose metabolism pathway and cell stress pathway, all of which might contribute to the overall TP-induced hepatotoxicity.
23562928	Anti-inflammatory activity of hexane extracts from bones and internal organs of Anguilla japonica suppresses cyclooxygenase-2-dependent prostaglandin D2 generation in mast cells and anaphylaxis in mice.	The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of n-hexane extracts from bones and internal organs of Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica (HEE), on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) generation in stem cell factor (SCF), IL-10, plus LPS-induced mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) and on passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in mice. HEE suppressed SCF/IL-10/LPS-induced PGD2 generation, and concomitantly reduced COX-2 protein expression dose-dependently. To understand the mechanistic basis for the inhibition of PGD2 generation by HEE, we examined the effects of HEE on upstream signaling pathways essential for COX-2 induction. HEE was found to inhibit the translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 subunit to the nucleus and its DNA-binding ability through the inhibition of TAK1, IKK and IκB phosphorylation. Furthermore, HEE also attenuated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated regulation of DNA binding of activator protein-1 (AP-1). Moreover, oral administration of HEE inhibited anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE-induced PCA in a dose dependent manner. Taken together, the present study provides new insights into the anti-inflammatory activity of HEE, which could be a promising candidate to be used for an inflammatory therapy.
22967140	Role of oestrogen receptors on the modulation of NADPH-diaphorase-positive cell number in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of ovariectomised female rats.	Modulation of the nitric oxide producing system (demonstrated via the NADPH-diaphorase histochemical reaction) by oestradiol has been established in several structures of the rat brain. The present study aimed to explore the possible regulation of NADPH-diaphorase activity by oestradiol in neurones of the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei and the role of oestrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) in this regulation. Adult ovariectomised rats were divided into six groups and injected either with vehicle or a single dose of oestradiol, a selective ERα agonist-PPT [4,4',4″-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol], a selective ERβ agonist-DPN [2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile], a selective ERα antagonist-MPP [1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy)phenol]-1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride] or a selective ERβ antagonist-PHTPP (4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl]phenol). The number of NADPH-diaphorase positive elements in the SON and the PVN was modulated by both ERs but, depending on the nucleus, ERα and ERβ ligands induced different effects. These results suggest that the regulation of nitrergic system by ERs may play a role in the control of oestrogen-dependent physiological mechanisms regulated by the SON and the PVN.
18282775	Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors delay human eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis in the absence and presence of salbutamol.	In asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the number of eosinophils and neutrophils in the lung is increased. One described mechanism leading to the impaired clearance of these cells from the lung is the delay in their programmed cell death (apoptosis). Selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are under development for the treatment of lung diseases because of their anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator activity. The aim of the present study was to establish whether inhibitors of PDE3, PDE4 and PDE5 modulate human eosinophil or neutrophil apoptosis or beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist- or cytokine-afforded survival. We also evaluated whether a PDE4 inhibitor could modulate the effect of a corticosteroid on eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured by using the relative DNA fragmentation assay and Annexin-V binding. Inhibitors of PDE4 (rolipram; 0.1-10 microM) and PDE3 (cilostazol; 0.1-10 microM) delayed spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 25% and 15%, respectively. A combination of a PDE4 or PDE3 inhibitor (10 microM) with salbutamol (100 nM) further delayed eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 42-49%. In neutrophils, rolipram (10 microM) also decreased apoptosis with a maximal inhibition of 13%. The combination of rolipram (10 microM) and salbutamol (100 nM) produced a 27% inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis. Inhibitor of cGMP-specific PDE5 (zaprinast; 0.1-10 microM) did not affect eosinophil apoptosis and only slightly increased spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. The effect of budesonide on apoptosis was not significantly modulated by a PDE4 inhibitor in eosinophils or neutrophils. The present results show that selective inhibitors of cAMP-hydrolyzing PDEs (PDE3 and PDE4) delay eosinophil apoptosis and, thus, increase their survival in vitro. Furthermore, beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists enhance the anti-apoptotic effects of PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors, suggesting that such drug combinations may prolong eosinophil and neutrophil longevity in the lung.
23262279	High-throughput identification and characterization of novel, species-selective GPR35 agonists.	Drugs targeting the orphan receptor GPR35 have potential therapeutic application in a number of disease areas, including inflammation, metabolic disorders, nociception, and cardiovascular disease. Currently available surrogate GPR35 agonists identified from pharmacologically relevant compound libraries have limited utility due to the likelihood of off-target effects in vitro and in vivo and the variable potency that such ligands exhibit across species. We sought to identify and characterize novel GPR35 agonists to facilitate studies aimed at defining the physiologic role of GPR35. PathHunter β-arrestin recruitment technology was validated as a human GPR35 screening assay, and a high-throughput screen of 100,000 diverse low molecular weight compounds was conducted. Confirmed GPR35 agonists from five distinct chemotypes were selected for detailed characterization using both β-arrestin recruitment and G protein-dependent assays and each of the human, mouse, and rat GPR35 orthologs. These studies identified 4-{(Z)-[(2Z)-2-(2-fluorobenzylidene)-4-oxo-1,3-thiazolidin-5-ylidene]methyl}benzoic acid (compound 1) as the highest potency full agonist of human GPR35 yet described. As with certain other GPR35 agonists, compound 1 was markedly selective for human GPR35, but displayed elements of signal bias between β-arrestin-2 and G protein-dependent assays. Compound 1 also displayed competitive behavior when assessed against the human GPR35 antagonist, ML-145 (2-hydroxy-4-[4-(5Z)-5-[(E)-2-methyl-3-phenylprop-2-enylidene]-4-oxo-2-sulfanylidene-1,3-thiazolidin-3-yl]butanoylamino]benzoic acid). Of the other chemotypes studied, compounds 2 and 3 were selective for the human receptor, but compounds 4 and 5 demonstrated similar activity at human, rat, and mouse GPR35 orthologs. Further characterization of these compounds and related analogs is likely to facilitate a better understanding of GPR35 in health and disease.
23590413	Canagliflozin , an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.	INTRODUCTION: Canagliflozin is an orally administered sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor proposed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Canagliflozin improves glycemic control in an insulin-independent fashion through inhibition of glucose reuptake in the kidney. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the available data on the pharmacodynamics, the pharmacokinetics and metabolism, and the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin. Relevant articles were identified via PubMed using the search term canagliflozin with no date restriction. The authors also discuss the abstracts from canagliflozin studies presented at large diabetes conferences. EXPERT OPINION: Canagliflozin offers a relatively modest reduction in HbA1c, FPG, and PPG. It has a low incidence of hypoglycemia and a reduction in body weight. Dose adjustment may be recommended in the elderly, those on loop diuretics, and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) if there are concerns or symptoms of volume-related side effects. Issues remain with observed increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the odds of heart attack and stroke. Canagliflozin offers a novel mechanism of action, a modest glycemic control, and a favorable side-effect profile. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2013 and is undergoing evaluation by the European Medicines Agency.
17062721	Treatment-related osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer.	The intended therapeutic effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists is hypogonadism, a major cause of acquired osteoporosis in men. Consistent with this observation, GnRH agonists increase bone turnover and decrease bone mineral density, a surrogate for fracture risk. Large claims-based analyses and other retrospective studies provide compelling evidence that GnRH agonists increase risk of clinical fractures. Estrogens play a central role in homeostasis of the normal male skeleton, and estrogen deficiency rather than testosterone deficiency seems to be primarily responsible for the adverse skeletal effects of GnRH agonists. In randomized controlled trials, bisphosphonates (pamidronate and zoledronic acid) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene and toremifene) increased bone mineral density in GnRH agonist-treated men. Two ongoing large randomized placebo-controlled studies will prospectively define fracture outcomes in men with prostate cancer and assess the efficacy of novel pharmacologic interventions (AMG162, toremifene) during GnRH agonist treatment.
23561166	Effects of fisetin supplementation on hepatic lipogenesis and glucose metabolism in Sprague-Dawley rats fed on a high fat diet.	The modulatory effects of daily fisetin supplementation for 8weeks on genes involved in hepatic lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis and hyperglycemia in rats fed a high fat (HF) diet were evaluated. Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPARγ, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fisetin supplementation decreases cardiovascular risks by ameliorating hepatic steatosis and lowering circulating glucose concentrations.
17010609	Gene expression profiling of breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide within the GEPARTRIO trial: HER-2, but not topoisomerase II alpha and microtubule-associated protein tau, is highly predictive of tumor response.	Gene expression analysis in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an interesting tool for identification of gene signatures and new markers to predict tumor response. However, the detection of predictive markers strongly depends on the drugs used in the specific therapeutic setting. There is growing evidence that topoisomerase II-alpha (TOPO IIalpha) is a marker for anthracycline-, and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) for taxane sensitivity. HER-2 has been described as a marker of both anthracycline and taxane sensitivity. We performed gene expression profiling of 50 patients within the GEPARTRIO study, an anthracycline and taxane neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial. Here we investigate the predictive value of TOPO IIalpha, MAPT and HER-2 mRNA expression for pathological complete response (pCR) in this setting. Interestingly, HER-2 gene expression was strongly predictive of pCR (P=0.017) as well as overall response (P=0.037) and clinical complete response (cCR, P=0.050). In contrast, for both TOPO IIalpha and MAPT no correlation with pCR was observed in our sample group.
15379894	The arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha activation of microglia and extends survival of G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice.	Familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be caused by mutations in copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Mice expressing SOD1 mutants demonstrate a robust neuroinflammatory reaction characterized, in part, by up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and its primary receptor TNF-RI. In an effort to identify small molecule inhibitors of neuroinflammation useful in treatment of ALS, a microglial culture system was established to identify TNFalpha antagonists. Walker EOC-20 microglia cells were stimulated with recombinant TNFalpha, with or without inhibitors, and the cell response was indexed by NO2- output. Three hundred and fifty-five rationally selected compounds were included in this bioassay. The arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase (5LOX) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a natural dicatechol, was one of the most potent non-cytotoxic antagonists tested (IC50 8 +/- 3 microm). Investigation of the G93A-SOD1 mouse model for ALS revealed increased message and protein levels of 5LOX at 120 days of age. Oral NDGA (2500 p.p.m.) significantly extended lifespan and slowed motor dysfunction in this mouse, when administration was begun relatively late in life (90 days). NDGA extended median total lifespan of G93A-SOD1 mice by 10%, and life expectancy following start of treatment was extended by 32%. Disease-associated gliosis and cleaved microtubule-associated tau protein, an indicator of axon damage, were likewise reduced by NDGA. Thus, TNFalpha antagonists and especially 5LOX inhibitors might offer new opportunities for treatment of ALS.
23192982	MLL histone methylases regulate expression of HDLR-SR-B1 in presence of estrogen and control plasma cholesterol in vivo.	High-density lipoprotein receptors scavenger receptor class B type I [HDLR-SR-B1 (SR-B1)] is a key player in reverse cholesterol transport and maintaining blood cholesterol. We demonstrated that human SR-B1 is transcriptionally activated by 17β-estradiol (E2) in HEPG2 and JAR cells. SR-B1 promoter contains multiple estrogen response elements (ERE half-sites) along with some Sp1 binding sites. Knockdown of estrogen receptor (ER)α and ERβ down-regulated E2-induced SR-B1 expression. ERs were bound to SR-B1 promoter EREs in an E2-dependent manner. Along with ERs, mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) histone methylases, especially MLL1 and MLL2, play key roles in E2-mediated SR-B1 activation. MLL1 and MLL2 bind to SR-B1 promoter in an E2-dependent manner and control the assembly of transcription pre-initiation complex and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment. ERs and MLLs play critical roles in determining the cholesterol uptake by steroidogenic tissues/cells, and their knockdown suppressed the E2-induced cholesterol uptake efficiencies of the cells. Intriguingly, MLL2 knockdown in mice resulted in a 33% increase in plasma cholesterol level and also reduced SR-B1 expression in mice liver, demonstrating its crucial functions in controlling plasma cholesterol in vivo.
23530011	Metabolic Effects of Chronic Cannabis Smoking.	OBJECTIVEWe examined if chronic cannabis smoking is associated with hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, reduced β-cell function, or dyslipidemia in healthy individuals.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSIn a cross-sectional, case-control study, we studied cannabis smokers (n = 30; women, 12; men, 18; 27 ± 8 years) and control subjects (n = 30) matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI (27 ± 6). Abdominal fat depots and intrahepatic fat content were quantified by magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Insulin-sensitivity indices and various aspects of β-cell function were derived from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT).RESULTSSelf-reported cannabis use was: 9.5 (2-38) years; joints/day: 6 (3-30) [median (range)]. Carbohydrate intake and percent calories from carbohydrates, but not total energy intake, were significantly higher in cannabis smokers. There were no group differences in percent total body fat, or hepatic fat, but cannabis smokers had a higher percent abdominal visceral fat (18 ± 9 vs. 12 ± 5%; P = 0.004). Cannabis smokers had lower plasma HDL cholesterol (49 ± 14 vs. 55 ± 13 mg/dL; P = 0.02), but fasting levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, or free fatty acids (FFA) were not different. Adipocyte insulin resistance index and percent FFA suppression during an OGTT was lower (P < 0.05) in cannabis smokers. However, oral glucose insulin sensitivity index, measures of β-cell function, or incretin concentrations did not differ between the groups.CONCLUSIONSChronic cannabis smoking was associated with visceral adiposity and adipose tissue insulin resistance but not with hepatic steatosis, insulin insensitivity, impaired pancreatic β-cell function, or glucose intolerance.
23278398	X-ray crystallography and computational docking for the detection and development of protein-ligand interactions.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the selective dysfunction and death of the upper and lower motor neurons. Median survival rates are between 3 and 5 years after diagnosis. Mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been linked to a subset of familial forms of ALS (fALS). Herein, we describe a fragment- based drug discovery (FBDD) approach for the investigation of small molecule binding sites in SOD1. X-ray crystallography has been used as the primary screening method and has been shown to directly detect protein-ligand interactions which cannot be unambiguously identified using other biophysical methods. The structural requirements for effective binding at Trp32 are detailed for a series of quinazoline-containing compounds. The investigation of an additional site that binds a range of catecholamines and the use of computational modelling to assist fragment evolution is discussed. This study also highlights the importance of ligand solubility for successful Xray crystallographic campaigns in lead compound design.
23567961	Identification of novel FLT3 kinase inhibitors.	FLT3 and PDGFR tyrosine kinases are important targets for therapy of different types of leukemia. Several FLT3/PDGFR inhibitors are currently under clinical investigation for combination with standard therapy for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however these agents only induce partial remission and development of resistance has been reported. In this work we describe the identification of potent and novel dual FLT3/PDGFR inhibitors that resulted from our efforts to screen a library of 25,607 small molecules against the FLT3 dependent cell line MOLM-13 and the PDGFR dependent cell line EOL-1. This effort led to the identification of five compounds that were confirmed to be active on additional FLT3 dependent cell lines (cellular EC50 values between 35 and 700 nM), while having no significant effect on 24 other tyrosine kinases.
23339682	Assessment of effects of IR and IPC on activities of cytochrome P450 isozymes in rats by a five-drug cocktail approach.	Abstract Background and objective: To evaluate the effects of ischemia and reperfusion (IR) and ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on the metabolic activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes in rats by a five-drug cocktail approach. Methods: Cocktail approach was used to evaluate the influence of IR and IPC on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, which were reflected by the changes of pharmacokinetic parameters of five specific probe drugs: caffeine, chlorzoxazone, tolbutamide, metoprolol and midazolam, respectively. Rats were randomly divided into IR, IPC and sham groups, and then injected the mixture of five probe drugs. Blood samples were collected at a series of time-points and the concentrations of probe drugs in plasma were determined by a HPLC method with UV detection. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the software of DAS 2.0. Results: The parameters including t(1/2β), CLs, AUC, MRT and K(10) exhibited a similar tendency for both IR and IPC groups. Compared with sham group, CLs and K(10) of five probe drugs were significantly lower (p < 0.05), AUC and t(1/2β) of five or some probe drugs were significantly increased in IR and IPC groups (p < 0.05). Compared with IPC group, CLs of five probe drugs were decreased and AUC were significantly increased in the IR group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: IR can variably decrease the activities of CYP isozymes in rats and this decrease can be attenuated by IPC.
10548525	Regulation of gene expression by activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma with rosiglitazone (BRL 49653) in human adipocytes.	To better define the mechanism of action of the thiazolidinediones, we incubated freshly isolated human adipocytes with rosiglitazone and investigated the changes in mRNA expression of genes encoding key proteins of adipose tissue functions. Rosiglitazone (10(-6) M, 4 h) increased p85alphaphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85alphaPI-3K) and uncoupling protein-2 mRNA levels and decreased leptin expression. The mRNA levels of insulin receptor, IRS-1, Glut 4, lipoprotein lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase, acylation-stimulating protein, fatty acid transport protein-1, angiotensinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and PPARgamma1 and gamma2 were not modified by rosiglitazone treatment. Activation of RXR, the partner of PPARgamma, in the presence of rosiglitazone, increased further p85alphaPI-3K and UCP2 mRNA levels and produced a significant augmentation of Glut 4 expression. Because p85alphaPI-3K is a major component of insulin action, the induction of its expression might explain, at least in part, the insulin-sensitizing effect of the thiazolidinediones.
12023686	Differences in AT2 -receptor stimulation between AT1 -receptor blockers valsartan and losartan quantified by renal interstitial fluid cGMP.	OBJECTIVE: Angiotensin II-receptor blockers are an established class of antihypertensive agents, but the differences between individual members of the class are largely unknown. The present study employed an animal model to demonstrate angiotensin II-receptor blocker-specific effects and to quantify these differences by comparing two common agents, losartan and valsartan. METHODS: We measured the effects on angiotensin II AT2-receptor-mediated renal cGMP by microdialysis in the outer renal cortex in conscious normotensive, sodium-depleted, 4-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats (n = 8) were given equimolar and equidepressor doses of losartan (0.02 mmol/kg) or valsartan (0.02 mmol/kg) either intravenously or orally. Time was allowed for the conversion of losartan into its active metabolite, EXP 3174. RESULTS: Both drugs had equal effects on blood pressure. There were significantly greater increases in cGMP levels after administration of valsartan than of losartan with both routes of administration. Intravenous administration of valsartan led to a 69.1% increase in cGMP, versus a 10.3% increase with losartan. Five hours after oral administration of valsartan, a 48% increase in cGMP was observed versus a 10.9% increase with losartan. The increase after oral administration of valsartan was sustained 8 h after administration, whereas the effect of losartan was not sustained. The effects of losartan and valsartan on cGMP were completely inhibited by AT2-receptor blockade. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that AT1-receptor blockade with valsartan influences AT2-receptor-mediated angiotensin II responses to a greater extent than with losartan, as quantified by renal interstitial fluid cGMP.
12411515	Halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane inhibit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of cardiac mitochondria.	We have investigated the effects of volatile anaesthetics on electron transport chain activity in the mammalian heart. Halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane reversibly increased NADH fluorescence (autofluorescence) in intact ventricular myocytes of guinea-pig, suggesting that NADH oxidation was impaired. Using pig heart submitochondrial particles we found that the anaesthetics dose-dependently inhibited NADH oxidation in the order: halothane > isoflurane = sevoflurane. Succinate oxidation was unaffected by either isoflurane or sevoflurane, indicating that these agents selectively inhibit complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). In addition to inhibiting NADH oxidation, halothane also inhibited succinate oxidation (and succinate dehydrogenase), albeit to a lesser extent. To test the hypothesis that complex I is a target of volatile anaesthetics, we examined the effects of these agents on NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.3) activity using the ubiquinone analogue DBQ (decylubiquinone) as substrate. Halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane dose-dependently inhibited NADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity. Unlike the classical inhibitor rotenone, none of the anaesthetics completely inhibited enzyme activity at high concentration, suggesting that these agents bind weakly to the 'hydrophobic inhibitory site' of complex I. In conclusion, halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane inhibit complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the electron transport chain. At concentrations of approximately 2 MAC (minimal alveolar concentration), the activity of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase was reduced by about 20 % in the presence of halothane or isoflurane, and by about 10 % in the presence of sevoflurane. These inhibitory effects are unlikely to compromise cardiac performance at usual clinical concentrations, but may contribute to the mechanism by which volatile anaesthetics induce pharmacological preconditioning.
15843826	Antimyeloma effects of a novel synthetic retinoid Am80 (Tamibarotene) through inhibition of angiogenesis.	In multiple myeloma (MM), the interaction between myeloma cells and bone marrow microenvironment has an important role in the pathogenesis of MM. We first examined the inducing effect of myeloma cells on migration of human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Five myeloma cell lines produced varying amounts of VEGF, and migration of HUVECs was induced by coculture with myeloma cells. We next examined the inhibitory effect of a novel synthetic retinoid Am80 (Tamibarotene) on both myeloma cells and HUVECs. Am80 is specific for the retinoic-acid receptor-alpha/beta, and has therapeutic effects in all-trans retinoic acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia. Am80 slightly inhibited the growth of both myeloma cells and HUVECs, and remarkably inhibited the growth of HUVECs stimulated by VEGF. Am80 showed little growth inhibition of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), but it markedly inhibited migration of HUVECs by cocultured myeloma cells. Am80 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor. In addition, VEGF-induced formation of tube-like structures in vitro and neovascularization in mouse corneas were significantly inhibited by Am80. These findings clearly demonstrate that Am80 is a potential inhibitor of angiogenesis caused by the interaction between vascular endothelial cells and myeloma cells, and might be a useful therapeutic agent against MM.
17234158	Pirfenidone inhibits TGF-beta expression in malignant glioma cells.	Due to its immunosuppressive properties, the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has become a promising target in the experimental treatment of human malignant gliomas. Here, we report that the antifibrotic drug 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone (pirfenidone, PFD) elicits growth-inhibitory effects and reduces TGF-beta2 protein levels in human glioma cell lines. This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.
23611293	Profiling 976 ToxCast chemicals across 331 enzymatic and receptor signaling assays.	Understanding potential health risks is a significant challenge due to large numbers of diverse chemicals with poorly characterized exposures and mechanisms of toxicities. The present study analyzes 976 chemicals (including failed pharmaceuticals, alternative plasticizers, food additives, and pesticides) in Phase I and II of the U.S. EPA's ToxCast™ project across 331 cell-free enzymatic and ligand-binding high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. Half-maximal activity concentrations (AC50) were identified for 729 chemicals in 256 assays (7,135 chemical-assay pairs). Some of the most commonly affected assays were CYPs (CYP2C9, CYP2C19), transporters (mitochondrial TSPO, norepinephrine, dopaminergic), and GPCRs (aminergic). Heavy metals, surfactants, and dithiocarbamate fungicides showed promiscuous, but distinctly different patterns of activity whereas many of the pharma compounds showed promiscuous activity across GPCRs. Literature analysis confirmed >50% of the activities for the most potent chemical-assay pairs (56), but also revealed 10 missed interactions. Twenty-two chemicals with known estrogenic activity were correctly identified for the majority (77%), missing only the weaker interactions. In many cases, novel findings for previously unreported chemical-target combinations clustered with known chemical-target interactions. Results from this large inventory of chemical-biological interactions can inform read-across methods as well as to link potential targets to molecular initiating events in adverse outcome pathways for diverse toxicities. This abstract does not necessarily reflect U.S. EPA policy.
22749926	Nicotine facilitates memory consolidation in perceptual learning.	Perceptual learning is a special type of non-declarative learning that involves experience-dependent plasticity in sensory cortices. The cholinergic system is known to modulate declarative learning. In particular, reduced levels or efficacy of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine were found to facilitate declarative memory consolidation. However, little is known about the role of the cholinergic system in memory consolidation of non-declarative learning. Here we compared two groups of non-smoking men who learned a visual texture discrimination task (TDT). One group received chewing tobacco containing nicotine for 1 h directly following the TDT training. The other group received a similar tasting control substance without nicotine. Electroencephalographic recordings during substance consumption showed reduced alpha activity and P300 latencies in the nicotine group compared to the control group. When re-tested on the TDT the following day, both groups responded more accurately and more rapidly than during training. These improvements were specific to the retinal location and orientation of the texture elements of the TDT suggesting that learning involved early visual cortex. A group comparison showed that learning effects were more pronounced in the nicotine group than in the control group. These findings suggest that oral consumption of nicotine enhances the efficacy of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Our findings further suggest that enhanced efficacy of the cholinergic system facilitates memory consolidation in perceptual learning (and possibly other types of non-declarative learning). In that regard acetylcholine seems to affect consolidation processes in perceptual learning in a different manner than in declarative learning. Alternatively, our findings might reflect dose-dependent cholinergic modulation of memory consolidation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
23432061	Possible Involvement of TRP Channels in Cardiac Hypertrophy and Arrhythmia.	Over the past 20 years, studies of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have significantly extended our knowledge regarding the molecular basis of Ca2+ signals in cardiac myocytes. The functional significance of cardiac TRP channels is likely connected to the alteration of membrane potential or Ca2+ entry into a noncontractile compartment, where gene expression responsible for various cardiac diseases is induced. This review highlights some aspects of TRP channels with anticipated roles in cardiac disease. Evidence suggests that (a) increased activities of TRPC1, TRPC3, or TRPC6 are involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, where these TRPC channels act as unique sensors for a wide range of hypertrophic stimuli, and (b) mutations in TRPM4 are now recognized as causes of human cardiac conduction disorders. Ultimately, TRP channels may become novel pharmacological targets in the treatment of human cardiac disease.
19852528	Palonosetron: in the prevention of nausea and vomiting.	Palonosetron is a second-generation serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with a distinct pharmacological profile that differs from first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Intravenous palonosetron is widely indicated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the acute and delayed phases following moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) and the prevention of CINV in the acute phase following highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). In the US, oral palonosetron is approved for the prevention of CINV in the acute phase following MEC (although this formulation is not currently available), and intravenous palonosetron is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the first 24 hours following surgery. All indications are currently limited to adult patients. Intravenous palonosetron was noninferior to intravenous ondansetron (with statistically greater efficacy than ondansetron) or dolasetron in preventing CINV following MEC, or to intravenous ondansetron or granisetron in preventing CINV following HEC, in the acute phase. Statistically greater efficacy was seen with intravenous palonosetron than ondansetron or dolasetron in preventing CINV following MEC in the delayed phase. Oral palonosetron was noninferior to intravenous palonosetron in preventing CINV in the acute phase in patients receiving MEC. Intravenous palonosetron was superior to placebo in preventing PONV in the first 24 hours following surgery. Palonosetron was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. Intravenous palonosetron is a valuable option in the prevention of acute- and delayed-phase CINV in adult patients receiving MEC, and of acute-phase CINV in patients receiving HEC. Oral palonosetron is likely to be a useful addition to oral formulations of other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in preventing CINV in patients receiving MEC. Intravenous palonosetron is a useful alternative to currently recommended agents in PONV prevention.
23579427	Acute alcohol effects on subtypes of impulsivity and the role of alcohol-outcome expectancies.	RATIONALE: It is well established that alcohol acutely impairs the ability to inhibit a pre-potent response (motor impulsivity), but its effects on cognitive impulsivity, including temporal (delayed gratification) and reflection (decision making) impulsivity, are not clear. An important factor contributing to the effects of alcohol is cognitive expectancies of alcohol-related outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The current study investigated the effect of alcohol, and alcohol outcome expectancies, on subtypes of impulsivity. METHODS: Impulsivity was tested using the Stop Signal, the Single Key Impulsivity and the Information Sampling Task for motor, temporal and reflection impulsivity, respectively. Participants (n = 48) received placebo, a low (0.4 g/kg) or high dose (0.8 g/kg) of alcohol, before completing the impulsivity measures. RESULTS: Motor impulsivity was affected by alcohol dose; participants receiving a high dose displayed reduced inhibitory control. Reflection impulsivity was affected by cognitive alcohol expectancies, but not by alcohol condition; participants expecting greater cognitive and behavioural impairment by alcohol exhibited low impulsivity. Temporal impulsivity was not affected by either alcohol dose or outcome expectancies. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the effects of alcohol on the subtypes of impulsivity are dissociable. Motor impulsivity is sensitive to the pharmacological effects of alcohol, whereas the reflection subtype is affected by cognitive alcohol expectancies. The findings have implications for the understanding of impulsive behaviour under the influence of alcohol.
23103562	TNF-α-mediated NF-κB survival signaling impairment by cisplatin enhances JNK activation allowing synergistic apoptosis of renal proximal tubular cells.	Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is an important limiting factor for cisplatin use. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is known to contribute to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by inducing an inflammatory process aggravating the primary injury, thereby resulting in acute kidney injury (AKI). The present study investigates the pathways synergistically activated by cisplatin and TNF-α responsible for TNF-α-enhanced cisplatin-induced renal cell injury. To do so, immortalized renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (IM-PTECs) were co-treated with TNF-α and cisplatin. Under these conditions, cisplatin induced dose-dependent apoptosis in IM-PTECs, which was significantly enhanced by TNF-α. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that cisplatin inhibited the typical TNF-α response and cisplatin/TNF-α treatment up-regulated cell death pathways while it down-regulated survival pathways compared to cisplatin alone. In concordance, the gene expression levels of kidney injury markers combined with activation of specific inflammatory mediators were enhanced by cisplatin/TNF-α treatment, resembling the in vivo cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity response. Furthermore, combined cisplatin/TNF-α treatment inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation and NF-κB-mediated gene transcription leading to enhanced and prolonged JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. JNK sustained activation further inhibited NF-κB signaling via a feedback loop mechanism. This led to an alteration in the transcription of the NF-κB-induced anti-apoptotic genes c-IAP2, Bcl-XL, Bruce and Bcl2 and pro-apoptotic genes Bfk and Xaf1 and consequently to sensitization of the IM-PTECs toward cisplatin/TNF-α-induced toxicity. In conclusion, our findings support a model whereby renal cells exposed to both cisplatin and TNF-α switch into a more pro-apoptotic and inflammatory program by altering their NF-κB/JNK/c-Jun balance.
6703688	The effect of vitamin B6 deficiency on alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase isoenzymes in rat liver.	Endogenous synthesis of oxalate has been reported to increase in vitamin B6 deficiency probably due to defective transamination of glyoxylate, the direct source of oxalate, to glycine. Alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) in the liver catalyzes most of the glyoxylate transamination in mammalian tissues (E. V. Rowsell, K. Snell, J. A. Carnie, and K. V. Rowsell (1972) Biochem. J. 127, 155-165). The effects of vitamin B6 deficiency on hepatic AGT isoenzymes, designated AGT 1 and AGT 2, respectively, were examined with male rats; AGT 1 is located both in the peroxisomes and in the mitochondria, and AGT 2 only in the mitochondria. The holo activity of combined peroxisomal and mitochondrial AGT 1 with a low Km for L-alanine rapidly decreased after a lag time of about 2 days during feeding of the vitamin B6-deficient diet (by 50% in 5 days, by 86% in 14 days). Peroxisomal AGT 1 activity was more affected than the mitochondrial. The holo activity of AGT 2 with a high Km for L-alanine decreased more slowly than AGT 1 (by 33% in 14 days, by 60% in 28 days). Urinary excretion of oxalate began to increase in 8-9 days, when AGT 2 remained intact but most of AGT 1 is depleted. When the defect in the glyoxylate transamination in vivo in vitamin B6 deficiency is considered, these findings suggest that it is due to the deficiency of AGT 1. The importance of peroxisomal AGT 1 is discussed, since peroxisomes have been described to be probably the major site of glyoxylate formation.
23288946	Cell wounding activates phospholipase D in primary mouse keratinocytes.	Plasma membrane disruptions occur in mechanically active tissues such as the epidermis and can lead to cell death if the damage remains unrepaired. Repair occurs through fusion of vesicle patches to the damaged membrane region. The enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) is involved in membrane traffickiing; therefore, the role of PLD in membrane repair was investigated. Generation of membrane disruptions by lifting epidermal keratinocytes from the substratum induced PLD activation, whereas removal of cells from the substratum via trypsinization had no effect. Pretreatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃, previously shown to increase PLD1 expression and activity, had no effect on, and a PLD2-selective (but not a PLD1-selective) inhibitor decreased, cell lifting-induced PLD activation, suggesting PLD2 as the isoform activated. PLD2 interacts functionally with the glycerol channel aquaporin-3 (AQP3) to produce phosphatidylglycerol (PG); however, wounding resulted in decreased PG production, suggesting a potential PG deficiency in wounded cells. Cell lifting-induced PLD activation was transient, consistent with a possible role in membrane repair, and PLD inhibitors inhibited membrane resealing upon laser injury. In an in vivo full-thickness mouse skin wound model, PG accelerated wound healing. These results suggest that PLD and the PLD2/AQP3 signaling module may be involved in membrane repair and wound healing.
12742526	Altered methionine metabolism in long living Ames dwarf mice.	Ames dwarf mice (df/df) are deficient in growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone and live significantly longer than their normal siblings. In the current study, we found that the hormone deficiencies affect methionine metabolism. We previously reported that the dwarf mice exhibit enzyme activities and levels that combat oxidative stress more efficiently than those of normal mice. Moreover, methionine or metabolites of methionine are involved in antioxidative processes. Thus, we performed an experiment that compared various parameters of methionine metabolism between 18-month old male dwarf (N=6) and wild type (N=5) mice. The specific activity of liver methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) was significantly elevated (205%, p<0.0001) in the dwarf mice, as were cystathionine synthase (50%, p<0.01), cystathionase (83%, p<0.001), and glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT, 91%, p<0.001) activities. Even though the activities of MAT and GNMT were elevated, the concentration of liver S-adenosylmethionine was decreased (24%, p<0.001) and S-adenosylhomocysteine increased (113%, p<0.001) in the dwarf mice. These data indicate that dwarf mice, compared to wild type mice, have a markedly different metabolism of methionine. Altered methionine metabolism may partially explain earlier reports indicating less oxidative damage to proteins in dwarf mice. Taken together, the data suggest that methionine metabolism may play a role in oxidative defense in the dwarf mouse and should be studied as a potential mechanism of extended lifespan.
22585450	Effects of Crataegus microphylla on vascular dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.	Vascular dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether chronic in vivo treatment of Crataegus microphylla (CM) extract in diabetic rats induced with streptozotocin (STZ, intraperitoneal, 65 mg/kg) preserves vascular function and to evaluate whether the reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), proinflammatory cytokines, and lipid peroxidation mediates its mechanisms of action. Starting at 4 weeks of diabetes, CM extract (100 mg/kg) was administrated to diabetic rats for 4 weeks. In aortic rings, relaxation to acetylcholine and vasoreactivity to noradrenaline were impaired, whereas aortic iNOS expression and plasma tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), total nitrite-nitrate, and malondialdehite levels were increased in diabetic rats compared with controls. Chronic CM treatment significantly corrected all the above abnormalities in diabetic rats. In comparison, pretreatment of the aorta of diabetic rats with N-[3(aminomethyl) benzyl]-acetamidine, dihydrochloride (10(-5)  M), a selective inhibitor of iNOS, produced a similar recovery in vascular reactivity. These results suggest that chronic in vivo treatment of CM preserves endothelium-dependent relaxation and vascular contraction in STZ-induced diabetes, possibly by reducing iNOS expression in the aorta and by decreasing plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-6 and by preventing lipid peroxidation.

23203941	Synthesis, characterization and pharmacodynamics of vitamin-B(12)-conjugated glucagon-like peptide-1.	Clearing the way: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are proving a potent weapon in the treatment of type II diabetes. A new vitamin B(12)-GLP-1 conjugate is investigated and shown to have insulinotropic properties similar to the unmodified peptide. These results are critical to the exploitation of the vitamin B(12) oral uptake pathway for peptide delivery.
17360906	NMDA receptor subunits have differential roles in mediating excitotoxic neuronal death both in vitro and in vivo.	Well-documented experimental evidence from both in vitro and in vivo models of stroke strongly supports the critical involvement of NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in neuronal damage after stroke. Despite this, the results of clinical trials testing NMDA receptor antagonists as neuroprotectants after stroke and brain trauma have been discouraging. Here, we report that in mature cortical cultures, activation of either synaptic or extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDA receptors results in excitotoxicity, increasing neuronal apoptosis. In contrast, activation of either synaptic or extrasynaptic NR2A-containing NMDA receptors promotes neuronal survival and exerts a neuroprotective action against both NMDA receptor-mediated and non-NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal damage. A similar opposing action of NR2B and NR2A in mediating cell death and cell survival was also observed in an in vivo rat model of focal ischemic stroke. Moreover, we found that blocking NR2B-mediated cell death was effective in reducing infarct volume only when the receptor antagonist was given before the onset of stroke and not 4.5 h after stroke. In great contrast, activation of NR2A-mediated cell survival signaling with administration of either glycine alone or in the presence of NR2B antagonist significantly attenuated ischemic brain damage even when delivered 4.5 h after stroke onset. Together, the present work provides a molecular basis for the dual roles of NMDA receptors in promoting neuronal survival and mediating neuronal damage and suggests that selective enhancement of NR2A-containing NMDA receptor activation with glycine may constitute a promising therapy for stroke.
15252033	The anticoagulant thrombin mutant W215A/E217A has a collapsed primary specificity pocket.	The thrombin mutant W215A/E217A features a drastically impaired catalytic activity toward chromogenic and natural substrates but efficiently activates the anticoagulant protein C in the presence of thrombomodulin. As the remarkable anticoagulant properties of this mutant continue to be unraveled in preclinical studies, we solved the x-ray crystal structures of its free form and its complex with the active site inhibitor H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH(2)Cl (PPACK). The PPACK-bound structure of W215A/E217A is identical to the structure of the PPACK-bound slow form of thrombin. On the other hand, the structure of the free form reveals a collapse of the 215-217 strand that crushes the primary specificity pocket. The collapse results from abrogation of the stacking interaction between Phe-227 and Trp-215 and the polar interactions of Glu-217 with Thr-172 and Lys-224. Other notable changes are a rotation of the carboxylate group of Asp-189, breakage of the H-bond between the catalytic residues Ser-195 and His-57, breakage of the ion pair between Asp-222 and Arg-187, and significant disorder in the 186- and 220-loops that define the Na(+) site. These findings explain the impaired catalytic activity of W215A/E217A and demonstrate that the analysis of the molecular basis of substrate recognition by thrombin and other proteases requires crystallization of both the free and bound forms of the enzyme.
12141946	Identification and characterization of a novel flavin-containing spermine oxidase of mammalian cell origin.	During polyamine catabolism, spermine and spermidine are first acetylated by spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and subsequently oxidized by polyamine oxidase (PAO) to produce spermidine and putrescine, respectively. In attempting to clone the PAO involved in this back-conversion pathway, we encountered an oxidase that preferentially cleaves spermine in the absence of prior acetylation by SSAT. A BLAST search using maize PAO sequences identified homologous mammalian cDNAs derived from human hepatoma and mouse mammary carcinoma: the encoded proteins differed by 20 amino acids. When either cDNA was transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells, intracellular spermine pools decreased by 75% while spermidine and N (1)-acetylspermidine pools increased, suggesting that spermine was selectively and directly oxidized by the enzyme. Substrate specificity using lysates of oxidase-transfected HEK-293 cells revealed that the newly identified oxidase strongly favoured spermine over N (1)-acetylspermine and that it failed to act on N (1)-acetylspermidine, spermidine or the preferred PAO substrate, N (1), N (12)-diacetylspermine. The PAO inhibitor, MDL-72,527, only partially blocked oxidation of spermine while a previously reported PAO substrate, N (1)-( n -octanesulphonyl)spermine, potently inhibited the reaction. Overall, the data indicate that the enzyme represents a novel mammalian oxidase which, on the basis of substrate specificity, we have designated spermine oxidase in order to distinguish it from the PAO involved in polyamine back-conversion. The identification of an enzyme capable of directly oxidizing spermine to spermidine has important implications for understanding polyamine homoeostasis and for interpreting metabolic and cellular responses to clinically relevant polyamine analogues and inhibitors.
23371451	Increased human dermal microvascular endothelial cell survival induced by cysteamine.	BACKGROUND: Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by intralysosomal cystine accumulation, treated with cysteamine. Recently, new adverse effects of cysteamine were reported. Skin biopsies showed microvascular proliferation (angioendotheliomatosis). To examine the mechanism of angioendotheliomatosis associated with cysteamine toxicity, we examined the effect of cysteamine on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC). METHODS: After cysteamine exposure (range 0-3.0 mM) during 24 h, cell viability was measured using water soluble tetrazolium salt-1 (WST-1) in both control HDMVEC and fibroblasts. Cell proliferation and apoptosis rate were measured in HDMVEC by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and caspase 3 and caspase 7 activity, respectively. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) was measured in HDMVEC after cysteamine exposure of 0, 0.1 or 1.0 mM. Medium and cysteamine were refreshed every 6 h to mimic the in vivo situation. Next, cell viability in HDMVEC was measured after 24 h of GSH exposure (range 0-10.0 mM). RESULTS: HDMVEC viability and proliferation increased after cysteamine exposure 0.03-3.0 mM (p < 0.01) and 0.03-1.0 mM (p = 0.01) respectively; cell viability in fibroblasts was not affected by incubation with cysteamine. Apoptosis remained unaffected by incubation with 0-1.0 mM cysteamine, 3.0 mM caused increased apoptosis. Intracellular GSH was significantly increased after incubation with cysteamine 0.1 mM (p = 0.02) and 1.0 mM (p < 0.01). HDMVEC viability increased after exposure to GSH 1.0-5.0 mM (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Cysteamine concentrations, similar to those described in plasma of cystinosis patients, stimulate HDMVEC viability and proliferation and increase intracellular GSH content. We postulate that this mechanism might underlie angioendotheliomatosis induced by cysteamine.
17210712	Pegylated recombinant human arginase (rhArg-peg5,000mw) inhibits the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma through arginine depletion.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is believed to be auxotrophic for arginine through the lack of expression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). The successful use of the arginine-depleting enzyme arginine deiminase (ADI) to treat ASS-deficient tumors has opened up new possibilities for effective cancer therapy. Nevertheless, many ASS-positive HCC cell lines are found to be resistant to ADI treatment, although most require arginine for proliferation. Thus far, an arginine-depleting enzyme for killing ASS-positive tumors has not been reported. Here, we provide direct evidence that recombinant human arginase (rhArg) inhibits ASS-positive HCCs. All the five human HCC cell lines we used were sensitive to rhArg but ADI had virtually no effect on these cells. They all expressed ASS, but not ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the enzyme that converts ornithine, the product of degradation of arginine with rhArg, to citrulline, which is converted back to arginine via ASS. Transfection of HCC cells with OTC resulted in resistance to rhArg. Thus, OTC expression alone may be sufficient to induce rhArg resistance in ASS-positive HCC cells. This surprising correlation between the lack of OTC expression and sensitivity of ASS-positive HCC cells shows that OTC-deficient HCCs are sensitive to rhArg-mediated arginine depletion. Therefore, pretreatment tumor gene expression profiling of ASS and OTC could aid in predicting tumor response to arginine depletion with arginine-depleting enzymes. We have also shown that the rhArg native enzyme and the pegylated rhArg (rhArg-peg(5,000mw)) gave similar anticancer efficacy in vitro. Furthermore, the growth of the OTC-deficient Hep3B tumor cells (ASS-positive and ADI-resistant) in mice was inhibited by treatment with rhArg-peg(5,000mw), which is active alone and is synergistic in combination with 5-fluorouracil. Thus, our data suggest that rhArg-peg(5,000mw) is a novel agent for effective cancer therapy.
11920914	Peripheral site ligands accelerate inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by neutral organophosphates.	The rates of inhibition of mouse acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) by paraoxon, haloxon, DDVP and enantiomers of neutral alkyl methylphosphonyl thioates and cationic alkyl methylphosphonyl thiocholines were measured in the presence and absence of AChE peripheral site inhibitors: gallamine, d-tubocurarine, propidium, atropine and derivatives of coumarin. All ligands, except the coumarins, at submillimolar concentrations enhanced the rates of inhibition by neutral organophosphates, whereas inhibition rates by cationic organophosphates were decreased. When peripheral site ligand concentrations extended to millimolar concentrations the extent of the enhancement decreased, creating a well-shaped activation profile. Analysis of inhibition by DDVP revealed that peripheral site inhibitors increase the second-order reaction rates by increasing maximal rates of phosphorylation. These observations suggest that peripheral site ligands are capable of allosterically affecting the conformation of residues in the choline binding site of AChE, thus optimizing the position of the leaving group of uncharged organophosphates during the inhibition reaction.
23265509	Purification, antioxidant activity and protein-precipitating capacity of punicalin from pomegranate husk.	Punicalin is a kind of ellagitannin, existing in pomegranate husk, and has shown remarkable biological activities. A rapid and large-scale separation method of punicalin from pomegranate husk was established, using medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC). The optimal mobile phase consisted of 5% methanol and 0.1% (v/v) TFA in water, and the optimal loading amount and flow rate were 1.0 g and 80 ml/min, respectively. Under this condition, 339 mg of 95.9% punicalin could be obtained in 40 min. 59.7 mg of 78.0% gallic acid could be separated simultaneously. This method was practical for industrial utilisation of pomegranate husk. Afterwards, the antioxidant and protein-precipitating capacities of the purified punicalin, together with punicalagin, were evaluated. Results showed that punicalin had strong antioxidant activity, and it exhibited a low affinity for protein. This suggested that the antioxidant of punicalin would not be greatly masked by tannin-protein precipitation in application, and hence confirmed punicalin to be a promising antioxidant.
23343565	Binary diffusion coefficients for mixtures of ionic liquids [EMIM][N(CN)2], [EMIM][NTf2], and [HMIM][NTf2] with acetone and ethanol by dynamic light scattering (DLS).	Mutual diffusivities for binary mixtures of the ionic liquids (ILs) [EMIM][N(CN)2] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanimide), [EMIM][NTf2] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide), and [HMIM][NTf2] (1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) with acetone and ethanol were studied in dependence on composition in the temperature range from 283.15 to 323.15 K, applying dynamic light scattering (DLS). The influence of experimental parameters on the achievable uncertainties was analyzed to ensure the acquisition of accurate data in adequate measurement times. For all probed systems, increasing binary diffusion coefficients were found for increasing temperatures. The systematic variation of anion and cation of the investigated ILs as well as a comparison with the literature data demonstrates the considerable influence of different ions on the resulting binary diffusion coefficients. Mutual diffusivities were found to be lower for the mixtures with ethanol than for those with acetone, which could be related to the formation of hydrogen bonds between ethanol and the ions. Most of the investigated IL solvent mixtures show increasing binary diffusion coefficients with increasing solvent concentration. For the mixtures of [EMIM][NTf2] with ethanol, however, a minimum of the mutual diffusivities was found in the ethanol mole fraction range from 0.7 to 0.8, which may hint at the vicinity of a critical demixing point. The viscosity of the pure ILs turned out to be no reliable indicator for the mutual diffusivity in mixtures with the same solvent.
23379686	Self-aggregation properties of ionic liquid 1,3-didecyl-2-methylimidazolium chloride in aqueous solution: from spheres to cylinders to bilayers.	The self-aggregation behavior of the double-chained ionic liquid (IL) 1,3-didecyl-2-methylimidazolium chloride ([C10C10mim]Cl) in aqueous solution has been investigated with a number of different experimental techniques. Two cmc values (cmc1 and cmc2) are obtained from conductivity measurements. The fraction of neutralized charge on the micellar surface suggests that cmc1 corresponds to the formation of spherical micelles and cmc2 to the transition from spherical to cylindrical micelles. Data obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy (using pyrene and Nile red as chemical probes), fluorescence anisotropy (using rhodamine B as probe), and chemical shift (1)H NMR (in D2O) provide a picture that is also consistent with a sphere-to-cylinder transition. This structural change is further confirmed by diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), from the self-diffusion coefficients for surfactant unimer and aggregates. Furthermore, a third evolution from cylindrical micelles to bilayer aggregates is proposed from the analysis of diffusion coefficients at high surfactant concentration ([IL] > 0.2 M). Phase scanning experiments performed with polarized light microscopy clearly demonstrate the presence of a lamellar liquid crystalline phase at very high IL concentration, thus confirming the coexistence of bilayer structures with elongated micelles, found at lower concentration. Additionally, [C10C10mim]Cl micelles are proposed as novel reaction media, as evidenced by the solvolysis reaction of 4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride (MBSC).
23456363	Hypoxia-inducible factor and vascular endothelial growth factor are targets of dietary soy during acute stroke in female rats.	Dietary soy and soy isoflavones are neuroprotective in experimental cerebral ischemia. Because these isoflavones have estrogenic properties, we hypothesized that, like estrogens, they would inhibit acute vascular injury and the detrimental acute increase in hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that leads to cerebral edema after stroke. Mature ovariectomized female Sprague Dawley rats were fed soy-free or soy-containing diets for 4 weeks followed by 90 minutes of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Similar to estrogens, dietary soy significantly reduced cerebral edema and vascular apoptosis 24 hours after stroke. Soy also inhibited the ischemia-induced increase in cortical VEGF and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 protein expression observed 4 and 24 hours after stroke, although mRNA levels increased. The reduction in VEGF/VEGFR-2 was associated both with decreases in receptor phosphorylation and signaling to AKT and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore degradation of the VEGFR-2 was increased with dietary soy. The primary ischemic stimulus for VEGF, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), was similarly reduced by dietary soy 4 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in both the cortex and striatum. The inhibition of HIF1α activity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in the HIF1α-activated apoptotic mediator BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (Nip3-like protein X). These data suggest that soy isoflavones target events early in the ischemic cascade as part of their neuroprotective actions and counterbalance some of the detrimental effects of the endogenous response to cerebral injury.
23567950	Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel aliphatic amido-quaternary ammonium salts for anticancer chemotherapy: Part II.	A series of novel aliphatic amido-quaternary ammonium salts were synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer effects involving induction of RhoB. Most of these compounds, featuring open-ring forms of aliphatic amido-quaternary ammonium salts, exhibited potent anti-proliferative activities in human cancer cell lines, including PC-3, NUGC-3, MDA-MB-231, ACHN, HCT-15, and NCI-H23. In further evaluation, the representative compound N,N-diethyl-N-(2-(N-methyltetradecanamido)ethyl)prop-2-en-1-aminium bromide (3b) exhibited potent pro-apoptotic activity, through RhoB activation, in HeLa cells.
23271002	In vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of 4-methoxy-5- hydroxycanthin-6-one, a natural alkaloid from Picrasma quassioides.	In the present study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of 4-methoxy-5- hydroxycanthin-6-one (CAN), a natural alkaloid isolated from Picrasma quassioides. CAN significantly inhibited the production of NO and the release of TNF-α induced by LPS in macrophage RAW 264.7. Western blot showed that CAN can downregulate the expression of iNOS protein. After oral administration, CAN (3, 9, and 27 mg/kg) reduced the development of carrageenan-induced paw edema and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced chronic arthritis in rats. The observed results indicated that pre-treatment with CAN might be an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases including chronic arthritis.
23292797	Smoothened is a fully competent activator of the heterotrimeric G protein G(i).	Smoothened (Smo) is a 7-transmembrane protein essential to the activation of Gli transcription factors (Gli) by hedgehog morphogens. The structure of Smo implies interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins, but the degree to which G proteins participate in the actions of hedgehogs remains controversial. We posit that the G(i) family of G proteins provides to hedgehogs the ability to expand well beyond the bounds of Gli. In this regard, we evaluate here the efficacy of Smo as it relates to the activation of G(i), by comparing Smo with the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor, a quintessential G(i)-coupled receptor. We find that with use of [(35)S]guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, first, with forms of G(i) endogenous to human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells made to express epitope-tagged receptors and, second, with individual forms of Gα(i) fused to the C terminus of each receptor, Smo is equivalent to the 5-HT(1A) receptor in the assay as it relates to capacity to activate G(i). This finding is true regardless of subtype of G(i) (e.g., G(i2), G(o), and G(z)) tested. We also find that Smo endogenous to HEK-293 cells, ostensibly through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, decreases intracellular levels of cAMP. The results indicate that Smo is a receptor that can engage not only Gli but also other more immediate effectors.
15563582	Structural determinants of arylacetic acid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs necessary for binding and activation of the prostaglandin D2 receptor CRTH2.	The chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates chemotaxis of inflammatory cells in response to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), is hypothesized to play a role in Th2-mediated allergic disease. In addition to PGD2, CRTH2 can be activated by indomethacin, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor and widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). To evaluate the structural features that confer CRTH2 binding selectivity, structure-activity relationship analysis of arylacetic acid class NSAIDs as CRTH2 receptor ligands was performed. Indomethacin, sulindac sulfide, and zomepirac displaced [3H]PGD2 binding at the mouse CRTH2 receptor (mCRTH2) with comparable affinity (Ki = 1.5 +/- 0.1, 2.5 +/- 0.4, and 3.3 +/- 0.3 microM, respectively). The indomethacin metabolite 5'-O-desmethyl indomethacin (5'-DMI) possessed binding affinity similar to indomethacin; however, elimination of the 2-methyl substituent on the indole ring resulted in a 10-fold decrease in binding affinity. No binding was detected for indole acetic acid and indole derivatives such as tryptophan, serotonin, and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid, demonstrating the importance of the N-acyl moiety of indomethacin. Neutral derivatives of indomethacin also failed to bind to mCRTH2, suggesting that the negatively charged carboxylate moiety participates in a key ligand-receptor interaction. Despite similar binding affinities, NSAID-type mCRTH2 ligands exhibited variable potencies as mCRTH2 agonists. Sulindac sulfide and 5'-DMI inhibited intracellular cyclic AMP ([cAMP]i) generation and stimulated cell migration comparable with indomethacin. In contrast, zomepirac did not inhibit [cAMP]i generation or stimulate cell migration but weakly antagonized the effects of indomethacin on [cAMP]i. Together, these results reveal structural features of arylacetic acid NSAIDs that may be exploited for the development of selective CRTH2 ligands.
23624419	Evaluation of the positive effects on insulin-resistance and β-cell measurements of vildagliptin in addition to metformin in type 2 diabetic patients.	We evaluated the positive effects of vildagliptin in addition to metformin on glycemic control and β-cell function in type 2 diabetic patients. One hundred and seventy-one type 2 diabetic patients were instructed to add vildaglipin 50mg twice a day or placebo to metformin for 12 months. Body mass index (BMI), glycemic control, fasting plasma insulin (FPI), HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, fasting plasma proinsulin (FPPr), proinsulin/fasting plasma insulin ratio (Pr/FPI ratio), C-peptide, glucagon, vaspin, visfatin, and omentin-1 were evaluated. Before, and after 12 months since the addition of vildagliptin, patients underwent a combined euglycemic hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic clamp, with subsequent arginine stimulation. Vildagliptin+metformin were more effective than placebo+metformin in reducing body weight and BMI, glycemic control, HOMA-IR, glucagon and insulin resistance measurements. Vildagliptin+metformin gave also a better increase of HOMA-β, and of all β-cell parameters after the clamp. We also recorded a significant correlation between M value increase and the decrease of vaspin, visfatin, and omentin-1 obtained with vildagliptin+metformin. Vildagliptin, in addition to metformin, proved to be effective in improving β-cell function and in reducing insulin resistance measurements.
23519149	Predictive factors of sensitivity to elisidepsin, a novel kahalalide f-derived marine compound.	Elisidepsin (PM02734, Irvalec®) is a synthetic marine-derived cyclic peptide of the Kahalalide F family currently in phase II clinical development. Elisidepsin was shown to induce rapid oncosis in ErbB3-expressing cells. Other predictive factors of elisidepsin sensitivity remained unknown. A panel of 23 cancer cell lines of different origin was assessed for elisidepsin cytotoxicity and correlated with mutational state, mRNA and protein expression of selected genes. Elisidepsin showed potent and broad cytotoxic effects in our cancer cell line panel, being active at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 2 μM that may be relevant for clinical settings. We have shown that elisidepsin is more active in cells harboring epithelial phenotype with high E-cadherin and low vimentin expression. In addition, high ErbB3 and Muc1 expression was correlated with sensitivity to elisidepsin, whereas the presence of KRAS activating mutations was associated with resistance. In DU-PM cells with acquired resistance to elisidepsin, ErbB3 expression was decreased, while Bcl2 was increased. DU-PM cells displayed higher sensitivity to ErbB1-inhibitors suggesting possible cross-talk of ErbB1 and ErbB3 signaling pathways. Combinations of elisidepsin with lapatinib and several chemotherapies including 5-FU and oxaliplatin resulted in synergistic effects that offer the potential of clinical use of elisidepsin in combination settings.
7905294	Ethanol inhibits glutamate-induced currents in heteromeric NMDA receptor subtypes.	Maximal L-glutamate/glycine-evoked currents were inhibited by ethanol in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing recombinant heteromeric NMDA receptors consisting of NR1-NR2A, NR1-NR2B, and NR1-NR2C subunit combinations. Concentration-dependent inhibition was observed at ethanol concentrations of > or = 50 mM both in Ca(2+)-containing and Ca(2+)-deficient, Ba(2+)-containing Mg(2+)-free media. The NR1-NR2C channels were slightly less sensitive to ethanol inhibition than the other heteromeric channels in Ca(2+)-deficient, Ba(2+)-containing medium. The inhibition was unaffected by the clamping-voltage and by a mutation [NR1-NR2A(N595Q)] that prevents the Mg(2+)-blockade of the channels, indicating that the mechanism of action of ethanol differs from that of Mg2+. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the NMDA receptor subtypes can mediate many behavioural actions of ethanol.
23261524	Live-cell imaging of p53 interactions using a novel Venus-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation system.	p53 plays an important role in regulating a wide variety of cellular processes, such as cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Dysfunction of p53 is frequently associated with several pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years substantial progress has been made in developing novel p53-activating molecules. Importantly, modulation of p53 interaction with its main inhibitor, Mdm2, has been highlighted as a promising therapeutic target. In this regard, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis, by providing direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells, offers a straightforward method to identify potential modulators of protein interactions. In this study, we developed a simple and robust Venus-based BiFC system to screen for modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions in live mammalian cells. We used nutlin-3, a well-known disruptor of p53-Mdm2 interaction, to validate the specificity of the assay. The reduction of BiFC signal mediated by nutlin-3 was correlated with an increase in Puma transactivation, PARP cleavage, and cell death. Finally, this novel BiFC approach was exploited to identify potential modulators of p53-Mdm2 complex formation among a commercially available chemical library of 33 protein phosphatase inhibitors. Our results constitute "proof-of-concept" that this model has strong potential as an alternative to traditional target-based drug discovery strategies. Identification of new modulators of p53-p53 and p53-Mdm2 interactions will be useful to achieve synergistic drug efficacy with currently used anti-tumor therapies.
14633707	Epidermal growth factor receptor autocrine signaling in RIE-1 cells transformed by the Ras oncogene enhances radiation resistance.	Oncogenic forms of the small GTPase Ras increase the resistance of cells to killing by ionizing radiation (IR). Although not all of the signaling pathways for radioresistance are well defined, it is now clear that Ras-dependent signaling pathways involved in radioresistance include those mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-K) and Raf. Nevertheless, PI3-K and Raf together are not sufficient to reconstitute all of the resistance conferred by Ras, indicating that other effectors must also contribute. We show here that Ras-driven autocrine signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also contributes to radioresistance in Ras-transformed cells. Conditioned media (CM) collected from RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells expressing oncogenic Ras increased the survival of irradiated cells. Ras-CM contains elevated levels of the EGFR ligand transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). Both Ras-CM and TGF-alpha stimulated EGFR phosphorylation, and exogenous TGF-alpha mimicked the effects of Ras-CM to increase radioresistance. Blocking EGFR signaling with the EGFR/HER-2 kinase inhibitor (KI) GW572016 decreased the postradiation survival of irradiated Ras-transformed cells and normal cells but had no effect on the survival of unirradiated cells. Ras-CM and TGF-alpha also increase PI3-K activity downstream of the EGFR and increase postradiation survival, both of which are abrogated by GW572016. Thus, Ras utilizes autocrine signaling through EGFR to increase radioresistance, and the EGFR KI GW572016 acts as a radiosensitizer. The observation that Ras-transformed cells can be sensitized to killing by ionizing radiation with GW572016 demonstrates that EGFR KIs could potentially be used to radiosensitize tumors in which radioresistance is dependent on Ras-driven autocrine signaling through EGFR.
11923794	Pharmacodynamic profile of the direct thrombin antagonist bivalirudin given in combination with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist eptifibatide.	BACKGROUND: Because of the adverse characteristics associated with heparin, direct antagonists of thrombin have been investigated as anticoagulants during percutaneous coronary interventions. However, the hematologic and clinical interactions between direct thrombin antagonists and inhibitors of platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa are incompletely explored. METHODS: Forty-two patients who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to receive a bivalirudin 1.0 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-hour infusion at 2.5 mg/kg/h; a bivalirudin 0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-hour infusion at 1.75 mg/kg; or a heparin 60 U/kg bolus. All the patients also received eptifibatide, given as 2 sequential boluses of 180 microg/kg followed by a 2 microg/kg/min infusion for 18 to 24 hours, and aspirin. RESULTS: After the bolus dose of the study drug, turbidimetric platelet aggregation in response to 5 micromol/L adenosine diphosphate increased in patients assigned to heparin but not those assigned to bivalirudin. After eptifibatide, platelet aggregation was eliminated in all 3 treatment groups. The effect of heparin and the effects of both bivalirudin regimens on the formation of thrombin antithrombin complexes and prothrombin fragment 1.2 were comparable. Neither agent affected the formation of platelet-monocyte complexes or expression of CD 63 lysosomal antigen. There were no major bleeding events, and a single non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) occurred in a patient treated with bivalirudin. CONCLUSION: These findings show the feasibility of combining the direct thrombin antagonist bivalirudin with a potent antagonist of platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. Clinical trials are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of this combination.
1692236	Differences in conformational stability between native and phosphorylated acetylcholinesterase as evidenced by a monoclonal antibody.	Monoclonal antibody 25B1 generated against diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate inhibited fetal bovine serum acetylcholinesterase has been extensively characterized with respect to its anticholinesterase properties. This antibody demonstrated considerably different properties from previously reported inhibitory antibodies raised against acetylcholinesterase in terms of the degree of inhibition (greater than 98%), the high degree of specificity, and the stability of the antigen-antibody complex. Monoclonal antibody 25B1 appears to be directed against a conformational epitope located in close proximity to the catalytic center of the enzyme and was found to be most suitable for studying the stabilization of the active site of acetylcholinesterase against denaturation by heat or guanidine following phosphorylation by organophosphorus anticholinesterase compounds. This approach allowed the determination of stability rank order of various phosphorylated acetylcholinesterases. Among all the organophosphates tested, the combination of a methyl group and a negatively charged oxygen attached to the P atom, CH3P(O)(O-)-AChE, conferred the greatest protection to the active site of aged or nonaged organophosphoryl conjugates of acetylcholinesterase.
10224140	Molecular cloning and characterization of a new multispecific organic anion transporter from rat brain.	A cDNA encoding the new member of the multispecific organic anion transporter family, OAT3, was isolated by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction cloning method. Degenerate primers were designed based on the sequences conserved among OAT1, OAT2, and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed using rat brain poly(A)+ RNA. The 536-amino acid protein sequence encoded by OAT3 showed 49, 39, and 36% identity to those of OAT1, OAT2, and OCT1, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that rat OAT3 mRNA is expressed in the liver, brain, kidney, and eye. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, OAT3 mediated the uptake of organic anions, such as p-aminohippurate (Km = 65 microM), ochratoxin A (Km = 0.74 microM), and estrone sulfate (Km = 2.3 microM) and a cationic compound, cimetidine. OAT3-mediated uptake of [3H]estrone sulfate was sodium-independent. para-Aminohippuric acid, estrone sulfate or ochratoxin A did not show any trans-stimulatory effect on either influx or efflux of [3H]estrone sulfate via OAT3. Organic anions such as sulfobromophthalein, probenecid, indocyanine green, bumetanide, piroxicam, furosemide, azidodeoxythymidine, 4, 4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-3,3'-disulfonic acid, and benzylpenicillin inhibited OAT3-mediated estrone sulfate uptake, while ouabain and digoxin did not. Organic cations such as tetraethylammonium, guanidine, verapamil, and quinidine did not interact with OAT3. Acidic metabolites of neurotransmitters derived from dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin inhibited the uptake of estrone sulfate via OAT3. These results suggest an important role of OAT3 in the excretion/detoxification of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, especially from the brain.
23528251	Cross-talk between constitutive androstane receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor in the regulation of gene expression.	Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase are often activated under similar physiological conditions. Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) translocates into the nucleus in accordance with 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and thus confers transactivation. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible link between CAR and HIFα. Phenobarbital (PB), a typical CAR activator, increased the gene expression of HIF-target genes in the livers of mice, including erythropoietin, heme oxygenase-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor-a. PB induced an accumulation of nuclear HIF-1α and an increase in the HIF-responsive element-mediated transactivation in HepG2 cells. Cobalt chloride, a typical HIF activator, induced the gene expression of CAR-target genes, including cyp2b9 and cyp2b10, an accumulation of nuclear CAR and an increase in the PB-responsive enhancer module-mediated transactivation in the mouse liver. Immunoprecipitation-immunoblot and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses suggest that CAR binds to the PB-responsive enhancer module with HIF-1α in the liver of untreated mice and that the complex dissociates upon PB treatment. Taken together these results suggest that CAR and HIF-α interact and reciprocally modulate the functions of each other.
23511125	Acetylcholinesterase inhibition reveals endogenous nicotinic modulation of glutamate inputs to CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons in hippocampal slices.	The involvement of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the neurotoxicological effects of soman, a potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor and a chemical warfare agent, is not clear. This is partly due to a poor understanding of the role of AChE in brain nAChR-mediated functions. To test the hypothesis that AChE inhibition builds sufficient acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain and facilitates nAChR-dependent glutamate transmission, we used whole-cell patch-clamp technique to record spontaneous glutamate excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons (SRI) in hippocampal slices. First, the frequency, amplitude and kinetics of EPSCs recorded from slices of control guinea pigs were compared to those recorded from slices of guinea pigs after a single injection of the irreversible AChE inhibitor soman (25.2μg/kg, s.c.). Second, EPSCs were recorded from rat hippocampal slices before and after their superfusion with the reversible AChE inhibitor donepezil (100nM). The frequency of EPSCs was significantly higher in slices taken from guinea pigs 24h but not 7 days after the soman injection than in slices from control animals. In 52% of the rat hippocampal slices tested, bath application of donepezil increased the frequency of EPSCs. Further, exposure to donepezil increased both burst-like and large-amplitude EPSCs, and increased the proportion of short (20-100ms) inter-event intervals. Donepezil's effects were suppressed significantly in presence of 10μM mecamylamine or 10nM methyllycaconitine. These results support the concept that AChE inhibition is able to recruit nAChR-dependent glutamate transmission in the hippocampus and such a mechanism can contribute to the acute neurotoxicological actions of soman.
23155202	Influence of coadministration of artemether and lumefantrine on selected plasma biochemical and erythrocyte oxidative stress indices in female Wistar rats.	Among the artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) regimens, artemisinin derivative, artemether in combination with lumefantrine (artemether-lumefantrine, AL) has achieved excellent results in the fight against malarial scourge. In this study, we evaluated the toxic potential of these drugs at the therapeutic doses in female Wistar rats. Animals were randomly divided into four groups: those administered 1% Tween 80 (control), those administered artemether (4 mg/kg body weight), those administered lumefantrine (24 mg/kg body weight), and those coadministered artemether (4 mg/kg body weight) and lumefantrine (24 mg/kg body weight). The drugs were orally administered twice daily for 3 days by gastric intubation after which selected plasma biochemical indices, and erythrocytes antioxidant defence and lipid peroxidation markers were evaluated. Coadministration of artemether and lumefantrine raised liver and renal function markers and increased atherogenic index. While reduced glutathione, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and catalase activities were reduced, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-s-transferase activities increased in all the treated groups compared to the control group. The drugs caused significant (p < 0.05) elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels compared to the control group. These results imply that coadministration of artemether and lumefantrine may increase the risks of atherosclerosis as well as liver and renal function impairments in the users. In addition, the drugs may also promote oxidative stress in the erythrocytes.
15110853	Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: aromatic and heterocyclic sulfonamides incorporating adamantyl moieties with strong anticonvulsant activity.	A series of aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides incorporating adamantyl moieties were prepared by reaction of aromatic/heterocyclic aminosulfonamides with the acyl chlorides derived from adamantyl-1-carboxylic acid and 1-adamantyl-acetic acid. Related derivatives were obtained from the above-mentioned aminosulfonamides with adamantyl isocyanate and adamantyl isothiocyanate, respectively. Some of these derivatives showed good inhibitory potency against two human CA isozymes involved in important physiological processes, CA I, and CA II, of the same order of magnitude as the clinically used drugs acetazolamide and methazolamide. The lipophilicity of the best CA inhibitors was determined and expressed as their experimental log k' IAM and theoretical ClogP value. Their lipophilicity was propitious with the crossing of the blood-brain barrier (log k' > IAM > 1.35). The anticonvulsant activity of some of the best CA inhibitors reported here has been evaluated in a MES test in mice. After intraperitoneal injection (30 mg kg(-1)), compounds A8 and A9 exhibited a high protection against electrically induced convulsions (> 90%). Their ED50 was 3.5 and 2.6 mg kg(-1), respectively.
12175785	A heterozygote phenotype is present in the jvs +/- mutant mouse livers.	The juvenile visceral steatosis (jvs) mouse, having a mutation in the carnitine transporter gene Octn2, is a model of primary systemic carnitine deficiency in humans (SCD, OMIM 212140). Like humans with SCD, homozygous jvs -/- mice have hepatic and cardiac steatoses, reduced plasma and tissue carnitines, and increased urinary carnitine clearance. Because symptomatic heterozygotes have been reported for some fatty acid oxidation disorders, including SCD, we compared the jvs heterozygotes to normal control mice. We measured the free and esterified carnitine, total cholesterol, and triglycerides in adult liver samples, myocardium, and skeletal muscle. Our results indicate significant differences between the livers of nonfasting adult normal (n = 8) vs jvs heterozygotes (n = 8) (means +/- SEM, p < 0.01) for the following parameters: free carnitine, 2.28 +/- 0.36 nmol/mg protein vs 0.41 +/- 0.13; total carnitine, 3.48 +/- 0.36 vs 1.27 +/- 0.25; triglycerides, 0.14 +/- 0.04 vs 0.39 +/- 0.02; and total cholesterol, 0.21 +/- 0.02 vs 0.39 +/- 0.04, but not for esterified carnitine, 1.18 +/- 0.17 vs 0.90 +/- 0.17 (p > 0.05). There is also a negative correlation between hepatic free carnitine and triglycerides from jvs heterozygotes (p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained with myocardium and skeletal muscle. We conclude that free and total carnitine levels are significantly lower in the heterozygote mouse liver and heart while triglyceride and total cholesterol levels are significantly higher. We speculate that in situations of lipolytic stress, some SCD heterozygotes might develop clinical symptoms of carnitine deficiency.
15860753	Glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation in airway cells after inhaled combination therapy.	Clinical evidence is accumulating for the efficacy of adding inhaled long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABAs) to corticosteroids in asthma. Corticosteroids bind to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they regulate gene expression. This article reports the first evidence in vivo of an interaction between inhaled LABA and corticosteroid on GR nuclear translocation in human airway cells using immunocytochemistry. We initially demonstrated significant GR activation 60 minutes after inhalation of 800 microg beclomethasone dipropionate in six healthy subjects. Subsequently, we determined the effects of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate (FP) in seven steroid-naive patients with asthma. We observed dose-dependent GR activation with 100- and 500-microg doses of FP, and to a lesser extent with 50 microg salmeterol alone. However, combination therapy with 100 microg FP and salmeterol augmented the action of FP on GR nuclear localization. In vitro, salmeterol enhanced FP effects on GR nuclear translocation in epithelial and macrophage-like airway cell lines. In addition, salmeterol in combination with FP enhanced glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-luciferase reporter gene activity and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and secretory leuko-proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) gene induction. Together, our data confirm that GR nuclear translocation may underlie the complementary interactions between LABAs and corticosteroids, although the precise signal transduction mechanisms remain to be determined.
17033106	Interaction of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with Helicobacter pylori in the stomach of humans and experimental animals.	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are major pathogenic factors in peptic ulcer disease but whether these two factors exert synergistic or antagonistic action on the gastric mucosa has been a subject of controversy. The classic concept states that there is an increased ulcer occurrence and bleeding in patients with both H. pylori infection and NSAID use. However, the question whether the H. pylori eradication therapy in NSAID users reduces the occurrence of peptic ulcer has not been fully addressed. Studies on secondary prevention of NSAID-associated ulcers in H. pylori patients have indicated that H. pylori eradication results in impaired ulcer healing with an effect on the rate of peptic ulcer occurrence. On the other hand, the treatment of H. pylori in patients with no prior history of chronic NSAID therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of peptic ulcer. Studies in experimental animals revealed for instance, that the H. pylori infection augments the gastric mucosal damage induced by NSAID in Mongolian gerbils. In rats with preexisting chromic gastric ulcers, H. pylori infection attenuated significantly the aspirin-induced inhibition of ulcer healing and accompanying fall in the gastric blood flow at the margin of these ulcers, suggesting negative interaction between aspirin and H. pylori on ulcerogenesis. Accumulated evidence in humans and animals shows that both aspirin and H. pylori upregulate the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 both at mRNA and protein levels at the ulcer margin, but failed to influence significantly that of COX-1. It was, therefore, proposed that H. pylori may in fact, antagonize, aspirin-induced delay of ulcer healing due to suppression of acid secretion by the enhancement in PGE(2) possibly derived from COX-2 expression and activity and to the overexpression of growth factors such as TGF alpha and VEGF. The present review summarizes and further addresses the issue of the interaction between these two major ulcer risk factors determined in the stomach of humans and experimental animals.
2120879	Role of extracellular calcium and calmodulin in prolactin secretion induced by hyposmolarity, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and high K+ in GH4C1 cells.	The mechanism by which 30% medium hyposmolarity induces PRL secretion by GH4C1 cells was compared with that induced by 100 nmol/l TRH or 30 mmol/l K+. Removing medium Ca2+, blocking Ca2+ channels with 50 mumol/l verapamil, or inhibiting calmodulin activation with 20 mumol/l trifluoperazine, 10 mumol/l chlorpromazine or 10 mumol/l pimozide almost completely blocked hyposmolarity-induced secretion. The smooth muscle relaxant, W-7, which is believed relatively specific in inhibiting the Ca2(+)-calmodulin interaction, depressed hyposmolarity-induced PRL secretion in a dose-dependent manner (r = -0.991, p less than 0.01). The above drugs also blocked or decreased high K(+)-induced secretion, but had much less effect on TRH-induced secretion. Secretion induced by TRH, hyposmolarity, or high K+ was optimal at pH 7.3-7.65 and was significantly depressed at pH 6.0 or 8.0, indicating that release of hormone induced by all 3 stimuli is due to an active cell process requiring a physiologic extracellular pH and is not produced by nonspecific cell toxicity. The data suggest hyposmolarity and high K+ may share some similarities in their mechanism of stimulating secretion, which is different from that of TRH.
23517733	Synthesis and selected immunological properties of substituted quino[3,2-b]benzo[1,4]thiazines.	A new type of azaphenothiazines - tetracyclic quino[3,2-b]benzo[1,4]thiazines, possessing common substituents (H, CH3, Cl, Br, F, CF3, SCH3) in positions 8-10 and pharmacophoric aminoalkyl substituents in position 6, were obtained from diquinodithiin and 2,2'-dichloro-3,3'-diquinolinyl disulfide in several-step syntheses. Sixty one compounds, grouped as the 6H, 6-dialkylaminoalkyl, 6-acylaminoalkyl and sulfonylaminoalkyl derivatives, were tested for cytotoxicity, their effects on phytohemagglutin A (PHA)-induced proliferative response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production by these cells. The compounds exhibited differential inhibitory activities in these tests and significantly varied in terms of cytotoxicity. The most promising compounds were tested for growth inhibition of leukemia L-1210 cells, colon cancer SV-948 cells and epidermal carcinoma A-341 cells. The most active compounds exhibited anticancer activity against these cell lines comparable to that of cisplatin. The structure-activity relationship of the compounds were discussed.
23297412	Resveratrol improves cardiomyopathy in dystrophin-deficient mice through SIRT1 protein-mediated modulation of p300 protein.	Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the α(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.
23122096	Quantitative determination of fatty acid chain composition in pork meat products by high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy.	High resolution (1)H NMR spectroscopy was proposed for the determination of the fatty acid chain profile of lipids in pork meat products during ripening. Two typical Mediterranean PDO salami produced in Calabria, a region in the Southern Italy, were chosen as a case of study. Quantitative NMR analysis provided the fatty acid chain profiles of total lipid extracts. The transesterification of total lipid extracts furnished FAME mixtures that enabled quantitation of fatty acid acyl chains in the acylglycerol and FFA portions. In all cases, oleyl chains were predominant, and high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acid chains were observed. The proposed spectroscopic method allowed also the estimation of the most important nutritional parameters of dry fermented meat products.
23608241	The effect of mitragynine on cAMP formation and mRNA expression of mu-opioid receptors mediated by chronic morphine treatment in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell.	ETHOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mitragynine is an indole alkaloid compound of Mitragyna speciosa (M. speciosa) Korth. (Rubiaceae). This plant is native to the southern regions of Thailand and northern regions of Malaysia and is frequently used to manage the withdrawal symptoms in both countries. AIM OF STUDY: To investigate the effect of mitragynine after chronic morphine treatment on cyclic AMP (cAMP) level and mRNA expression of mu-opioid receptor (MOR) in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Mitragynine was isolated from the Mitragyna speciosa plant using the acid-base extraction method. The cAMP level upon forskolin stimulation in the cells was determined using the Calbiochem(®) Direct Immunoassay Kit. The mRNA expression of the MOR was carried out using quantitative RT-PCR. RESULT: Cotreatment and pretreatment of morphine and mitragynine significantly reduced the production of cAMP level at a lower concentration of nitrogen while the higher concentration of this compound could lead to the development of tolerance and dependence as shown by the increase of the cAMP level production in foskolin stimulation. In MOR mRNA expression study, cotreatment of morphine with mitragynine significantly reduced the down-regulation of MOR mRNA expression as compared to morphine treatment only. CONCLUSION: These finding suggest that mitragynine could possibly avoid the tolerance and dependence on chronic morphine treatment by reducing the up-regulation of cAMP level as well as reducing the down-regulation of MOR at a lower concentration of mitragynine.
9256165	Inhibition of extracellular release of proinflammatory secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) by sulfasalazine: a novel mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity.	Sulfasalazine is widely used in rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The mechanisms of its activity have not been elucidated. In leukocytes, sulfasalazine and its analogue, CL 42A, inhibited the formation of leukotrienes and possibly of the second messenger compounds at the level of phospholipase C. Partial inhibition of interleukin-lbeta (IL-1beta), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was also found. Since the synthesis of eicosanoids is induced by phospholipase A2 and since secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is proinflammatory, we investigated the impact of sulfasalazine and related compounds on mRNA, protein synthesis, and release of sPLA2 from osteoblasts. Sulfasalazine and CL 42A markedly inhibited extracellular release of sPLA2. The impact of sulfasalazine was evident at 50 microM (P < 0.001) and maximal at 400 microM, and that of CL 42A at 10 microM (P < 0.001) and 200 microM, respectively. Split products of sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (400 microM) and sulfapyridine (400 microM), had no impact. The effect of sulfasalazine and CL 42A was evident regardless of whether the cells were stimulated with IL-1beta/TNF-alpha, lipopolysaccharide/forskolin, or dibutyryl-cAMP. Sulfasalazine and CL 42A did not alter the level of sPLA2 mRNA. Exposure of stimulated fetal rat calvaria osteoblasts (FRCO) to sulfasalazine did not show accumulation of the intracellular sPLA2 protein as tested by western blot; however, enzymatic activity of PLA2 in disrupted cells was definitely increased. Thus, the impact is on the post-transcriptional release of sPLA2 rather than on the synthesis. There was also an increase in the extracellular release of prostaglandin E2 from FRCO exposed to sulfasalazine or to CL 42A. In contrast, sulfasalazine had no effect on the extracellular release of gelatinase from the cells or on mRNA of cytosolic PLA2 or cyclooxygenase 2. We conclude that the anti-inflammatory activity of sulfasalazine may be related, in part, to the selective inhibition of the extracellular release of proinflammatory sPLA2.
17512091	Downregulation of glutaredoxin but not glutathione loss leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in female mice CNS: implications in excitotoxicity.	Oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction play synergistic roles in neurodegeneration. Maintenance of thiol homeostasis is important for normal mitochondrial function and dysregulation of protein thiol homeostasis by oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We examined the critical roles played by the antioxidant, non-protein thiol, glutathione and related enzyme, glutaredoxin in maintaining mitochondrial function during excitotoxicity caused by beta-N-oxalyl amino-L-alanine (L-BOAA), the causative factor of neurolathyrism, a motor neuron disease involving the pyramidal system. L-BOAA causes loss of GSH and inhibition of mitochondrial complex I in lumbosacral cord of male mice through oxidation of thiol groups, while female mice are resistant. Reducing GSH levels in female mice CNS by pretreatment with diethyl maleate or L-propargyl glycine did not result in inhibition of complex I activity, unlike male mice. Further, treatment of female mice depleted of GSH with L-BOAA did not induce inhibition of complex I indicating that GSH levels were not critical for maintaining complex I activity in female mice unlike their male counterpart. Glutaredoxin, a thiol disulfide oxidoreductase helps maintain redox status of proteins and downregulation of glutaredoxin results in loss of mitochondrial complex I activity. Female mice express higher levels of glutaredoxin in certain CNS regions and downregulation of glutaredoxin using antisense oligonucleotides sensitizes them to L-BOAA toxicity seen as mitochondrial complex I loss. Ovariectomy downregulates glutaredoxin and renders female mice vulnerable to L-BOAA toxicity as evidenced by activation of AP1, loss of GSH and complex I activity indicating the important role of glutaredoxin in neuroprotection. Estrogen protects against mitochondrial dysfunction caused by excitotoxicity by maintaining cellular redox status through higher constitutive expression of glutaredoxin in the CNS. Therapeutic interventions designed to upregulate glutaredoxin may offer neuroprotection against excitotoxicity in motor neurons.
23535287	Cajaninstilbene acid (CSA) exerts cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress through the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway.	Cajaninstilbene acid (CSA), an active compound separated from pigeon pea leaves, possesses the highly efficient antioxidant activities. Transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator of cellular oxidative stress. This study examined the role of Nrf2 in CSA-mediated antioxidant effects on human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cell line. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon H2O2 and CSA treatment was lower than that of H2O2 alone. CSA activated Nrf2 as evaluated by Western blotting. A luciferase reporter assay also demonstrated that CSA-activated signaling resulted in the increased transcriptional activity of Nrf2 through binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) enhancer sequence. Our study indicated that treatment of HepG2 cells with CSA induces Nrf2-dependent ARE activity and gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunits by activation of PI3K/AKT, ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Inhibition of Nrf2 by siRNA reduced CSA-induced upregulation of these Nrf2-related enzymes. These results suggest that the Nrf2/ARE pathway plays an important role in the regulation of CSA-mediated antioxidant effects in HepG2 cells.
23583884	2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced inflammatory activation is mediated by intracellular free calcium in microglial cells.	2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been known to induce inflammatory signaling in a number of cell types and tissues. However, the adverse effects of TCDD on the central nervous system (CNS) have not been entirely elucidated. In this study, using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and ELISA, we showed that TCDD up-regulated the expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in a time-dependent manner in cultured HAPI microglial cells. TCDD also caused a fast (within 30min as judged by the increase in its mRNA level) activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). This initial action was accompanied by up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an important inflammation marker within 1h after TCDD treatment. These pro-inflammatory responses were inhibited by two types of Ca(2+) blockers, bis-(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) and nifedipine, thus, indicating that the effects are triggered by initial increase in the intracellular concentration of free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i). Further, TCDD exposure could induce phosphorylation- and ubiquitination-dependent degradation of IкBα, and the translocation of NF-κB p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus in this microglial cell line. Thus, the NF-κB signaling pathway can be activated after TCDD treatment. However, Ca(2+) blockers also obviously attenuated NF-κB activation and transnuclear transport induced by TCDD. In concert with these results, we highlighted that the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine and NF-κB activation induced by TCDD can be mediated by elevation of [Ca(2+)]i in HAPI microglial cells.
8991786	Effects of zonisamide on dopaminergic system.	Effects of zonisamide (ZNS) on extracellular dopamine (DA), its precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) levels in the striatum as well as hippocampus of freely moving rats were studied. Intracellular DA, DOPA, DOPAC and HVA levels, as well as DOPA accumulation as an index of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the rat brain in vivo, DA re-uptake in the striatum and hippocampus, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities were also determined. Acute administrations of therapeutic ZNS doses (20 and 50 mg/kg) increased striatal extracellular DOPA levels, intracellular striatal and hippocampal DOPA levels, and stimulated DOPA accumulation in both brain regions. ZNS also increased striatal and hippocampal intracellular as well as extracellular DA and HVA levels, but decreased those of DOPAC levels. Chronic (3 weeks) administrations of therapeutic ZNS doses (20 and 50 mg/kg/day) increased intracellular DA, DOPA, DOPAC and HVA levels in striatum and hippocampus. ZNS-induced changes were greater in intracellular levels than in extracellular levels. Acute and chronic supratherapeutic ZNS dose (100 mg/kg) administration decreased intracellular levels of all substances detectable in both brain regions, and inhibited DOPA accumulation. Both subtypes of MAO (type A and type B) activities were weakly inhibited by ZNS. ZNS showed no effect on DA re-uptake in striatum nor in hippocampus. These results suggest that therapeutic ZNS doses increase DOPA accumulation as well as both intracellular and extracellular DA, DOPA and HVA levels. However, such doses also decrease extracellular and intracellular DOPAC levels by enhancing DA synthesis and/or by selectively inhibiting MAO-B activities. In addition, chronic therapeutic ZNS dose administration enhances DA synthesis, which results in increased intracellular DA, its precursor and its metabolites levels. On the other hand, both acute and chronic supratherapeutic ZNS dose administrations inhibit DA turnover. These ZNS effects on DA metabolism are at least partly involved in the mechanisms of action of ZNS.
9631585	A case of therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia with t(16;21)(q24;q22) after chemotherapy with DNA-topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and mitoxantrone, and the alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide.	A 59-year-old female suffering from malignant lymphoma developed therapy-related acute myeloblastic leukemia (t-AML) after chemotherapy consisting of treatment with DNA-topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and mitoxantrone, and an alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide. The cumulative dose of etoposide administration was 5500 mg; 1500 mg given intravenously and 4000 mg orally. One year later, she suddenly developed AML of FAB M2. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells revealed deletion of 7q and a rare translocation, t(16;21)(q24;q22). Southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells did not detect rearrangement of the AML1 gene, however, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of bone marrow cells at interphase and metaphase revealed a translocational splitting between chromosome 21 involving AML1 gene and chromosome 16. These results suggest that the breakpoint is not located in the breakpoint cluster region for t(8;21). The patient was treated with chemotherapy and entered complete remission.
23381951	Pharmacogenetics of Allopurinol-Making an Old Drug Safer.	Allopurinol is a drug that has been used for decades to lower serum urate levels in patients with gout or chronic renal failure and in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy at risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Patients may develop cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild rashes to potentially fatal severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) namely drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Recent studies have demonstrated the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*58:01 allele and allopurinol-induced SCARs, which might explain ethnic differences in their incidences. Genotyping is now required before starting abacavir and carbamazepine so as to identify individuals susceptible to SJS. However, no genetic screening is advocated before commencement of allopurinol. The lack of availability of a rapid and inexpensive screening test for the HLA-B*58:01 allele is one of the obstacles to such screening. Development of a test that is quick, accurate, and cost-effective is warranted.
20387803	Measuring binding kinetics of ligands with tethered receptors by fluorescence polarization and total internal reflection fluorescence.	Binding kinetics of nuclear receptors and their specific ligands was measured using polarization anisotropy complemented with total internal reflection fluorescence. Binding affinities of tethered full length human estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) with 17beta-estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, raloxifene, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, tamoxifen, and genistein were measured to be 100 (as reference), 100, 35, 21, 8, and 1.5, respectively. They agreed with published results. For the first time, rate constants were measured, and off rates were 1.5, 1.5, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7, and 2.3 x 10(-3) s(-1) while on rates were 11, 10, 3.3, 2.4, 1.0, and 0.26 x 10(5) M(-1)s(-1), respectively. For the antiestrogen drugs, their comparable off-rates correlated well with their equally similar potency. Eleven ginsenosides were screened as potential ligands. None were found to bind to ERalpha, but Rb1(S) and 20(S)-Rg3 were shown to bind to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. The latter finding corroborated strongly with the therapeutic effects of ginsenosides on diabetic mice observed in a separate study. Our method would complement surface plasmon resonance assay for small ligands in the mass range of tens to hundreds of Daltons.
23265191	Mammalian frataxin controls sulfur production and iron entry during de novo Fe4S4 cluster assembly.	Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-containing proteins are essential components of cells. In eukaryotes, Fe-S clusters are synthesized by the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) machinery and the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) system. In the mammalian ISC machinery, preassembly of the Fe-S cluster on the scaffold protein (ISCU) involves a cysteine desulfurase complex (NFS1/ISD11) and frataxin (FXN), the protein deficient in Friedreich's ataxia. Here, by comparing the biochemical and spectroscopic properties of quaternary (ISCU/NFS1/ISD11/FXN) and ternary (ISCU/NFS1/ISD11) complexes, we show that FXN stabilizes the quaternary complex and controls iron entry to the complex through activation of cysteine desulfurization. Furthermore, we show for the first time that in the presence of iron and L-cysteine, an [Fe(4)S(4)] cluster is formed within the quaternary complex that can be transferred to mammalian aconitase (mACO2) to generate an active enzyme. In the absence of FXN, although the ternary complex can assemble an Fe-S cluster, the cluster is inefficiently transferred to ACO2. Taken together, these data help to unravel further the Fe-S cluster assembly process and the molecular basis of Friedreich's ataxia.
16959378	Reduced plasma membrane surface expression of GLAST mediates decreased glutamate regulation in the aged striatum.	Extracellular L-glutamate poses a severe excitotoxic threat to neurons and glia when unregulated, therefore low synaptic levels of this neurotransmitter must be maintained via a rapid and robust transport system. A recent study from our laboratory showed a reduced glutamate uptake rate in the striatum of the aged Fischer 344 (F344) rat, yet the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unknown. The current study utilized in vivo electrochemical recordings, immunoblotting and biotinylation in young (6 months), late-middle aged (18 months) and aged (24 months) F344 rats to elucidate the potential role that glutamate transporters (GLT-1, GLAST, and EAAC1) may play in this mechanism. Here we show that the time necessary to clear glutamate from the late-middle aged and aged striatum is significantly prolonged in comparison to the young striatum. In addition, an analysis of various sub-regions of the striatum revealed a marked dorsoventral gradient in terms of glutamate clearance times in the aged striatum, a phenomenon which was not present in the striatum of the animals of the remaining age groups. We also found that the decreased glutamate clearance time observed in the late-middle aged and aged rats is not due to a decrease in the production of total transporter protein among these three transporters. Rather, a significant reduction in the amount of GLAST expressed on the plasma membrane surface in the aged animals (approximately 55% when compared to young rats) may contribute to this phenomenon. These age-related alterations in extracellular l-glutamate regulation may be key contributors to the increased susceptibility of the aged brain to excitotoxic insults such as stroke and hypoxia.
19480470	Duloxetine: a review of its use in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.	Duloxetine (Cymbalta(R)) is a potent serotonin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) in the CNS. It is indicated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as well as other indications. In patients with GAD of at least moderate severity, oral duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily was effective with regard to improvement from baseline in assessments of anxiety and functional impairment, and numerous other clinical endpoints. Longer-term duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily also demonstrated efficacy in preventing or delaying relapse in responders among patients with GAD. In addition, duloxetine was generally well tolerated, with most adverse events being of mild to moderate severity in patients with GAD in short- and longer-term trials. Additional comparative and pharmacoeconomic studies are required to position duloxetine among other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs. However, available clinical data, and current treatment guidelines, indicate that duloxetine is an effective first-line treatment option for the management of GAD. Duloxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin and noradrenaline transporters, and a weak inhibitor of dopamine transporters. It has a low affinity for neuronal receptors, such as alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenergic, dopamine D(2), histamine H(1), muscarinic, opioid and serotonin receptors, as well as ion channel binding sites and other neurotransmitter transporters, such as choline and GABA transporters. It does not inhibit monoamine oxidase types A or B. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in healthy volunteers were dose proportional over the range of 40-120 mg once daily. Steady state was typically reached by day 3 of administration. Duloxetine may be administered without regard to food or time of day. Duloxetine is highly protein bound and is widely distributed throughout tissues. It is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and 2D6, and its numerous metabolites, which are inactive, are mainly excreted in the urine. The mean elimination half-life of duloxetine is approximately 12 hours. Duloxetine is a substrate for CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Concomitant use of duloxetine and potent CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided and duloxetine should be used with caution in patients receiving drugs that are extensively metabolized by CYP2D6, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index. Duloxetine was effective in the short-term treatment of patients with primary GAD of at least moderate severity. In four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase III trials, duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily for 9 or 10 weeks was significantly more effective than placebo with regard to the primary endpoint of mean change in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) total score from baseline to study endpoint. In addition, all other endpoints were generally improved from baseline to a greater extent with duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily than with placebo. Duloxetine also improved patient role functioning (assessed using Sheehan Disability Scale global impairment functioning scores), health-related quality of life and patient well-being compared with placebo. Duloxetine was effective in patients with GAD who were aged >/=65 years. Pooled results of data from the two short-term efficacy trials that also included an active comparator arm showed that the mean change in HAM-A scores with duloxetine relative to placebo were of the same magnitude as those with venlafaxine extended release versus placebo. Duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily was also more effective than placebo in preventing or delaying relapse in responders to duloxetine in a longer-term study. In this study, patients with GAD received duloxetine during a 26-week, open-label, acute treatment phase and responders were then randomized to continue on duloxetine or receive placebo during a 26-week, double-blind, continuation phase. Time to relapse was significantly longer in duloxetine recipients than in placebo recipients. In addition, significantly fewer duloxetine recipients than placebo recipients relapsed during the double-blind phase of the trial and more duloxetine recipients achieved remission. Short- (9-10 weeks) and longer-term (52 weeks) treatment with duloxetine 60-120 mg once daily was generally well tolerated in patients with GAD, with the majority of adverse events being of mild to moderate severity. Nausea, dry mouth, headache, constipation, dizziness and fatigue were among the most common treatment-emergent adverse events. The adverse event profile of duloxetine did not differ with dose or treatment duration. Significantly more patients receiving short-term duloxetine than placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, with nausea being the only event that resulted in significantly more treatment discontinuations in duloxetine recipients than in placebo recipients. Serious adverse events were uncommon with both short- and longer-term duloxetine treatment. Two episodes of attempted suicide and one episode of completed suicide occurred in duloxetine recipients during the 24-week open-label phase of a longer-term trial. No deaths or suicides were reported in any of the short-term trials. Discontinuation-emergent adverse events, most commonly nausea and dizziness, occurred in up to one-third of duloxetine recipients in the short-term trials.
10362188	A multicenter, randomized study of argatroban versus heparin as adjunct to tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in acute myocardial infarction: myocardial infarction with novastan and TPA (MINT) study.	OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effect of a small-molecule, direct thrombin inhibitor, argatroban, on reperfusion induced by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUND: Thrombin plays a crucial role in thrombosis and thrombolysis. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that argatroban has advantages over heparin for the inhibition of clot-bound thrombin and for the enhancement of thrombolysis with TPA. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five patients with AMI within 6 h were randomized to heparin, low-dose argatroban or high-dose argatroban in addition to TPA. The primary end point was the rate of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow at 90 min. RESULTS: TIMI grade 3 flow was achieved in 42.1% of heparin, 56.8% of low-dose argatroban (p = 0.20 vs. heparin) and 58.7% of high-dose argatroban patients (p = 0.13 vs. heparin). In patients presenting after 3 h, TIMI grade 3 flow was significantly more frequent in high-dose argatroban versus heparin patients: 57.1% versus 20.0% (p = 0.03 vs. heparin). Major bleeding was observed in 10.0% of heparin, and in 2.6% and 4.3% of low-dose and high-dose argatroban patients, respectively. The composite of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock or congestive heart failure, revascularization and recurrent ischemia at 30 days occurred in 37.5% of heparin, 32.0% of low-dose argatroban and 25.5% of high-dose argatroban patients (p = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Argatroban, as compared with heparin, appears to enhance reperfusion with TPA in patients with AMI, particularly in those patients with delayed presentation. The incidences of major bleeding and adverse clinical outcome were lower in the patients receiving argatroban.
23047828	Circulating very-low-density lipoprotein from subjects with impaired glucose tolerance accelerates adrenocortical cortisol and aldosterone synthesis.	Apart from their role in cardiovascular homeostasis and immunomodulation, aldosterone and cortisol are also implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Furthermore, glycoxidative modifications of lipoproteins are increasingly recognized as an etiological factor for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in prediabetic individuals. The causative relationship between in vivo lipoprotein modifications and steroidogenesis in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), however, is not well defined. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of in vivo modified lipoproteins on aldosterone and cortisol release from human adrenocortical H295R cells. Following an oral glucose tolerance test, 20 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 20 IGT subjects were randomly selected from the ongoing PRAEDIAS prevention study in our department. Cells were incubated for 24 h with lipoproteins isolated from NGT and IGT individuals and aldosterone and cortisol release was measured in the supernatants. VLDL induced a greater stimulating effect on adrenocortical aldosterone and cortisol release compared to HDL and LDL. Moreover, IGT-VLDL evoked a significantly higher effect (p<0.05) on hormone release than NGT-VLDL. Incubation of cells with in vitro modified lipoproteins and specific pharmacological inhibitors suggests that VLDL presumably recruits ERK1/2 as one of the downstream effectors of Jak-2. In summary, in vivo modified VLDL are able to promote prediabetic hormonal dysregulation by modulating adrenocortical steroidogenesis via Jak-2-ERK dependent pathway.
16647263	High-mannose-type glycan modifications of dihydrofolate reductase using glycan-methotrexate conjugates.	Various high-mannose-type glycan modifications of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) were achieved by ligand-based approach using glycan-methotrexate (MTX) conjugates as tight binding glycan bearing ligands for DHFR. The resulting glycan-MTX conjugates and the corresponding artificial glycoproteins could be useful as oligosaccharide- and glycoprotein-probes to perform quantitative analysis of glycan recognizing protein such as lectins, glycosyltransferases or glycosidases. Moreover, artificial glycoproteins having two different high-mannose-type glycans were developed for the first time by a combination of two different types of glycan modification strategies.
23404305	Predicting Macro- and Microvascular Complications in Type 2 Diabetes: The Japan Diabetes Complications Study/the Japanese Elderly Diabetes Intervention Trial risk engine.	OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a risk engine that calculates the risks of macro- and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed pooled data from two clinical trials on 1,748 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients without diabetes complications other than mild diabetic retinopathy with a median follow-up of 7.2 years. End points were coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, noncardiovascular mortality, overt nephropathy defined by persistent proteinuria, and progression of retinopathy. We fit a multistate Cox regression model to derive an algorithm for prediction. The predictive accuracy of the calculated 5-year risks was cross-validated. RESULTS Sex, age, HbA1c, years after diagnosis, BMI, systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, atrial fibrillation, current smoker, and leisure-time physical activity were risk factors for macro- and microvascular complications and were incorporated into the risk engine. The observed-to-predicted (O/P) ratios for each event were between 0.93 and 1.08, and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests showed no significant deviations between observed and predicted events. In contrast, the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine overestimated CHD risk (O/P ratios: 0.30 for CHD and 0.72 for stroke). C statistics in our Japanese patients were high for CHD, noncardiovascular mortality, and overt nephropathy (0.725, 0.696, and 0.767) but moderate for stroke and progression of retinopathy (0.636 and 0.614). By combining macro- and microvascular risks, the classification of low- and high-risk patients was improved by a net reclassification improvement of 5.7% (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS The risk engine accurately predicts macro- and microvascular complications and would provide helpful information in risk classification and health economic simulations.
10683249	Characterization and partial purification of microsomal NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases.	Quinone oxidoreductases are flavoproteins that catalyze two-electron reduction and detoxification of quinones. This leads to the protection of cells against toxicity, mutagenicity, and cancer due to exposure to environmental and synthetic quinones and its precursors. Two cytosolic forms of quinone oxidoreductases [NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2)] were previously identified, purified, and cloned. A role of cytosolic NQO1 in protection of cells from oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, and mutagenicity of quinones was established. Currently, we have characterized and partially purified the NQO activity from rat liver microsomes. This activity was designated as microsomal NQO (mNQO). The mNQO activity showed significantly higher affinity for NADH than NADPH as electron donors and catalyzed reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and menadione. The mNQO activity was insensitive to dicoumarol, a potent inhibitor of cytosolic NQO1. Western analysis of microsomal proteins revealed 29- and 18-kDa bands that cross-reacted with polyclonal antibodies raised against cytosolic NQO1. The mNQO activity was partially purified by solubilization of microsomes with detergent Chaps, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography. The microsomal mNQO proteins are expected to provide additional protection after cytosolic NQOs against quinone toxicity and mutagenicity.
17604186	Neuroprotective effect of nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced chemical kindling and associated biochemical parameters in mice.	Brain cyclooxygenases (COX), the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin synthesis, is rapidly and transiently induced by convulsions in hippocampal and cortical neurons. Previous studies have explored the protective effect of naproxen (non-selective COX-inhibitor) or rofecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor) against chemical kindling in mice. With this background, the present study was designed to explore the possible effect of nimesulide (a preferential COX-2 inhibitor) against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling epilepsy in mice. To induce kindling, PTZ was injected in a subconvulsive dose (40 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for 15 days. Nimesulide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered each day 45 min before either PTZ or vehicle challenge. The intensity of kindling was assessed immediately after PTZ administration according to a prevalidated scoring scale. On 16th day i.e. 24 h after the last dose of PTZ, animals were sacrificed and various biochemical parameters were assessed in the whole brain. Compared with normal control group, PTZ-kindled mice had significantly higher levels of malondialdehyde, nitrite, myeloperoxidase but had lower levels of reduced glutathione in the whole brain homogenate. Chronic treatment with nimesulide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) for 15 days showed significant decrease in kindling score and could play a role in controlling the accompanying biochemical alterations due to PTZ. These results suggested that nimesulide, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor offered neuroprotection against PTZ-induced kindling in mice.
13129570	Synthesis and in vitro pharmacology at AMPA and kainate preferring glutamate receptors of 4-heteroarylmethylidene glutamate analogues.	2-Amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(2-thiazolyl)-4-isoxazolyl]propionic acid (1) is a potent AMPA receptor agonist with moderate affinity for native kainic acid (KA) receptors, whereas (S)-E-4-(2,2-dimethylpropylidene)glutamic acid (3) show high affinity for the GluR5 subtype of KA receptors and much lower affinity for the GluR2 subtype of AMPA receptors. As an attempt to develop new pharmacological tools for studies of GluR5 receptors, (S)-E-4-(2-thiazolylmethylene)glutamic acid (4a) was designed as a structural hybrid between 1 and 3. 4a was shown to be a potent GluR5 agonist and a high affinity ligand and to indiscriminately bind to the AMPA receptor subtypes GluR1-4 with lower affinities. Compounds 4b-h, in which the 2-thiazolyl substituent of 4a was replaced by other heterocyclic rings, which have previously been incorporated as 5-substituents in AMPA analogues, as exemplified by 1 were also synthesized. Compounds 4b-h were either inactive (4e,f) or weaker than 4a as affinity ligands for GluR1-4 and GluR5 with relative potencies comparable with those of the corresponding AMPA analogues as AMPA receptor agonists. Compounds 4a-h may be useful tools for the progressing pharmacophore mapping of the GluR5 agonist binding site.
22986217	Soy isoflavones modulate adipokines and myokines to regulate lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver of male Huanjiang mini-pigs.	Although a growing body of evidence suggests that soy isoflavones help regulate lipid metabolism, the underlying mechanism has not yet been thoroughly clarified. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of soy isoflavones on the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in different adipose tissue depots, skeletal muscle and liver of male Huanjiang mini-pigs, as well as the expression of adipokines and myokines. A total of 36 male Huanjiang mini-pigs were fed basal diet (control, Con), low-dose soy isoflavones (LSI) and high-dose soy isoflavones (HSI). The results showed that LSI and HSI regulated the expression of genes involved in the anabolism and catabolism of fatty acids in dorsal subcutaneous (DSA), abdominal subcutaneous (ASA) and perirenal (PRA) adipose tissue depots, as well as longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) and liver. LSI and HSI also regulated the expression of adipokines in DSA, ASA and PRA, and the expression of myokines in LDM in male Huanjiang mini-pigs. In addition, soy isoflavones regulated plasma glucose, leptin and adiponectin contents after treatment for two months. Our results indicate that soy isoflavones, by regulating the expression of adipokines and myokines, may regulate the metabolism of lipids and could have potential therapeutic applications in lipid abnormalities.
23378624	Pancreatic β-Cell Dysfunction and Risk of New-Onset Diabetes After Kidney Transplantation.	OBJECTIVEChronic exposure to calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids poses renal transplant recipients (RTR) at high risk for development of new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction may be crucial to the pathophysiology of NODAT and specific markers for β-cell dysfunction may have additive value for predicting NODAT in this population. Therefore, we prospectively investigated whether proinsulin, as a marker of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, is associated with future development of NODAT and improves prediction of it.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSAll RTR between 2001 and 2003 with a functioning graft for ≥1 year were considered eligible for inclusion, except for subjects with diabetes at baseline who were excluded. We recorded incidence of NODAT until April 2012.RESULTSA total of 487 RTR (age 50 ± 12 years, 55% men) participated at a median time of 6.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 2.6-11.5) years after transplantation. Median fasting proinsulin levels were 16.6 (IQR, 11.0-24.2) pmol/L. During median follow-up for 10.1 (IQR, 9.1-10.4) years, 42 (35%) RTR had development of NODAT in the highest quartile of the distribution of proinsulin versus 34 (9%) in the lowest three quartiles (P < 0.001). In Cox regression analyses, proinsulin (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-2.83; P < 0.001) was strongly associated with NODAT development. This was independent of age, sex, calcineurine inhibitors, prednisolone use, components of the metabolic syndrome, or homeostasis model assessment.CONCLUSIONSIn conclusion, fasting proinsulin is strongly associated with NODAT development in RTR. Our results highlight the role of β-cell dysfunction in the pathophysiology of NODAT and indicate the potential value of proinsulin for identification of RTR at increased risk for NODAT.
23345168	Blocking the proliferation of human tumor cell lines by peptidase inhibitors from Bauhinia seeds.	In cancer tumors, growth, invasion, and formation of metastasis at a secondary site play a pivotal role, participating in diverse processes in the development of the pathology, such as degradation of extracellular matrix. Bauhinia seeds contain relatively large quantities of peptidase inhibitors, and two Bauhinia inhibitors were obtained in a recombinant form from the Bauhinia bauhinioides species, B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor, which is a cysteine and serine peptidase inhibitor, and B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor, which is a serine peptidase inhibitor. While recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor inhibits human neutrophil elastase cathepsin G and the cysteine proteinase cathepsin L, recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor inhibits plasma kallikrein and plasmin. The effects of recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor on the viability of tumor cell lines with a distinct potential of growth from the same tissue were compared to those of the clinical cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil. At 12.5 µM concentration, recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor were more efficient than 5-fluorouracil in inhibiting MKN-28 and Hs746T (gastric), HCT116 and HT29 (colorectal), SkBr-3 and MCF-7 (breast), and THP-1 and K562 (leukemia) cell lines. Additionally, recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor inhibited 40 % of the migration of Hs746T, the most invasive gastric cell line, while recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor did not affect cell migration. Recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor, even at high doses, did not affect hMSC proliferation while 5-fluorouracil greatly reduced the proliferation rates of hMSCs. Therefore, both recombinant B. bauhinoides cruzipain inhibitor and recombinant B. bauhinioides kallikrein inhibitor might be considered for further studies to block peptidase activities in order to target specific peptidase-mediated growth and invasion characteristics of individual tumors, mainly in patients resistant to 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy.
23313730	The effect of manganese on dopamine toxicity and dopamine transporter (DAT) in control and DAT transfected HEK cells.	Chronic exposure to Mn results in the development of a neurological disorder known as manganism characterized by neurological deficits resembling that seen in Parkinsonism. Although dopaminergic neurons within the nigrostriatal pathway appear intact, Mn-induced irregularities in DA transmission have been observed including decreased amphetamine-induced DA release and loss of the dopamine transporter (DAT). Results of studies to evaluate the effect of Mn and DA on cell viability in control and DAT-transfected HEK cells reveal that Mn is equally toxic to both cell lines whereas DA was only toxic to cells containing DAT. DA toxicity was saturable suggesting that transport may be rate limiting. When Mn and DA were added simultaneously to the media, cell toxicity was similar to that produced by Mn alone suggesting that Mn may suppress DA uptake in the DAT containing cells. Preincubation of DA prior to the addition of Mn resulted in cell death which was essentially additive with that produced independently by the two agents. Mn was also shown to decrease DA uptake and amphetamine-induced DA efflux in DAT containing cells. Time-lapsed confocal microscopy indicates that Mn can promote trafficking of cell surface DAT into intracellular compartments which may account for the decrease in DA uptake and DA efflux in these cells. Mn-induced internalization of DAT may provide an explanation for disruption in DA transmission previously reported in the striatum.
10200266	The NDUFA1 gene product (MWFE protein) is essential for activity of complex I in mammalian mitochondria.	The MWFE polypeptide of mammalian complex I (the proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase) is 70 amino acids long, and it is predicted to be a membrane protein. The NDUFA1 gene encoding the MWFE polypeptide is located on the X chromosome. This polypeptide is 1 of approximately 28 "accessory proteins" identified in complex I, which is composed of 42 unlike subunits. It was considered accessory, because it is not one of the 14 polypeptides making up the core complex I; a homologous set of 14 polypeptides can make a fully functional proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase in prokaryotes. One MWFE mutant has been identified and isolated from a collection of respiration-deficient Chinese hamster cell mutants. The CCL16-B2 mutant has suffered a deletion that would produce a truncated and abnormal MWFE protein. In these mutant cells, complex I activity is reduced severely (<10%). Complementation with hamster NDUFA1 cDNA restored the rotenone-sensitive complex I activity of these mutant cells to approximately 100% of the parent cell activity. Thus, it is established that the MWFE polypeptide is absolutely essential for an active complex I in mammals.
17653141	Influence of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 1173C/T genotype on the risk of hemorrhagic complications in African-American and European-American patients on warfarin.	The association of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 1173C/T genotype and risk of hemorrhage among African Americans and European Americans is presented. This association was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression with adjustment for demographics, comorbidity, and time-varying covariates. Forty-four major and 203 minor hemorrhages occurred over 555 person-years among 446 patients (60.6+/-15.6 years, 50% men, 227 African Americans). The variant CYP2C9 genotype conferred an increased risk for major (hazard ratio (HR) 3.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-8.0) but not minor (HR 1.3; 95% CI: 0.8-2.1) hemorrhage. The risk of major hemorrhage was 5.3-fold (95% CI: 0.4-64.0) higher before stabilization of therapy, 2.2-fold (95% CI: 0.7-6.5) after stabilization, and 2.4-fold (95% CI: 0.8-7.4) during all periods when anticoagulation was not stable. The variant VKORC1 1173C/T genotype did not confer a significant increase in risk for major (HR 1.7; 95% CI: 0.7-4.4) or minor (HR 0.8; 95% CI: 0.5-1.3) hemorrhage. The variant CYP2C9 genotype is associated with an increased risk of major hemorrhage, which persists even after stabilization of therapy.
23164615	Differential modulation of retinal ganglion cell light responses by orthosteric and allosteric metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 compounds.	To investigate the role of mGluR8 in modulating the synaptic responses of retinal ganglion cells, we used a recently identified positive allosteric modulator of mGluR8, AZ12216052 (AZ) and the mGluR8-specific orthosteric agonist (S)-3,4-dicarboxyphenylglycine (DCPG). These agents were applied to whole-cell voltage-clamped ganglion cells from an isolated, superfused mouse retina preparation. DCPG reduced OFF-ganglion cell excitatory currents, whereas AZ enhanced the peak excitatory currents in ON-, OFF-, and ON-OFF-ganglion cells. The effects on ganglion cell inhibitory currents were more varied. The effects of the allosteric modulator were stronger for bright stimuli than for dim stimuli, consistent with receptor stimulation by endogenous glutamate being stronger during bright light stimulation and with mGluR8 receptors mainly being localized away from glutamate release sites, immuno-labeled with VGLUT1. The differential sensitivity of ganglion cell light responses to DCPG and AZ supports multiple sites where mGluR8 modulates the light responses of ganglion cells.
23104245	Comparative study of equimolar doses of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) on catalepsy after acute and chronic administration.	Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and its precursors 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD) and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) are known drugs of abuse. The ability of acute and chronic administration of equimolar doses of GHB (200mg/kg), 1,4-BD (174mg/kg) and GBL (166mg/kg) to produce catalepsy in male Swiss Webster mice was examined. GHB, 1,4-BD, GBL produced catalepsy when injected acutely. Drug treatment was then continued for 14days. Tolerance development was determined on days 6, 14, and challenged with a higher dose on day 15 in those chronically pretreated mice, and compared with naïve mice. Chronic GHB produced tolerance to catalepsy, as evidenced from area under the curve (AUC) of catalepsy versus time (min-sec) on days 6 (678±254), 14 (272±247), which were less than those on day 1 (1923±269). However, less tolerance was seen from GBL or 1,4-BD, as AUCs on days 6 and 14 were not significantly lower than that of day 1. In conclusion, although equimolar doses were used, expecting similar levels of GHB in the body, 1,4-BD and GBL shared only some of the in vivo effects of GHB. The rate of metabolic conversion of 1,4-BD and GBL into GHB might be responsible for the differences in the tolerance development to these drugs.
23274907	Permanent Neonatal Diabetes in INSC94Y Transgenic Pigs.	Mutations in the insulin (INS) gene may cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Ins2 mutant mouse models provided important insights into the disease mechanisms of PNDM but have limitations for translational research. To establish a large animal model of PNDM, we generated INS(C94Y) transgenic pigs. A line expressing high levels of INS(C94Y) mRNA (70-86% of wild-type INS transcripts) exhibited elevated blood glucose soon after birth but unaltered β-cell mass at the age of 8 days. At 4.5 months, INS(C94Y) transgenic pigs exhibited 41% reduced body weight, 72% decreased β-cell mass (-53% relative to body weight), and 60% lower fasting insulin levels compared with littermate controls. β-cells of INS(C94Y) transgenic pigs showed a marked reduction of insulin secretory granules and severe dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum. Cataract development was already visible in 8-day-old INS(C94Y) transgenic pigs and became more severe with increasing age. Diabetes-associated pathological alterations of kidney and nervous tissue were not detected during the observation period of 1 year. The stable diabetic phenotype and its rescue by insulin treatment make the INS(C94Y) transgenic pig an attractive model for insulin supplementation and islet transplantation trials, and for studying developmental consequences of maternal diabetes mellitus.
1322791	Amsacrine and etoposide hypersensitivity of yeast cells overexpressing DNA topoisomerase II.	Increasing the cellular concentration of DNA topoisomerase II in yeast by expressing constitutively a plasmid-borne TOP2 gene encoding the enzyme greatly increases the sensitivity of the cells to amsacrine and etoposide (VP-16). This increased drug sensitivity at a higher intracellular DNA topoisomerase II level is observed in both RAD52+ repair-proficient strains and rad52 mutants that are defective in the repair of double-stranded breaks. These results provide strong support of the hypothesis that the cellular target of these drugs is DNA topoisomerase II, and that these drugs kill cells by converting DNA topoisomerase II into a DNA damaging agent.
17016711	Different responses to dexamethasone and prednisolone in the same depressed patients.	RATIONALE: Patients with major depression show hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, but the mechanisms underlying this abnormality are still unclear. OBJECTIVES: We have compared two synthetic glucorticoids, dexamethasone and prednisolone, in their ability to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in depressed patients. Dexamethasone probes glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function, while prednisolone probes both GR and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a single-blind, repeated-measure design. We administered placebo, prednisolone (5 mg) or dexamethasone (0.5 mg), at 22:00, to 18 severe, treatment-resistant depressed inpatients (15 of them with a history of childhood trauma) and 14 healthy volunteers. On the following days, we collected salivary cortisol from 9:00 to 22:00. RESULTS: Depressed patients had higher salivary cortisol levels compared with controls, at baseline and after both prednisolone and dexamethasone (p<0.001). Consistent with previous studies, depressed inpatients showed impaired suppression by dexamethasone: based on the analysis of the areas under the curve (AUCs), suppression by dexamethasone (0.5 mg) was -85% in controls vs -46% in depressed patients (p=0.018). However, the same depressed patients showed normal suppression by prednisolone (5 mg): suppression was -41% in controls and -36% in depressed patients (p=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the additional effects of prednisolone on the MR explain the different responses to these glucocorticoids in the same depressed patients.
23212963	Adsorption of phenanthrene, 2-naphthol, and 1-naphthylamine to colloidal oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes: effects of humic acid and surfactant modification.	Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can exist in the form of colloidal suspension in aquatic environments, particularly in the presence of natural organic matter or surfactants, and may significantly affect the fate and transport of organic contaminants. In the present study, the authors examined the adsorption of phenanthrene, 2-naphthol, and 1-naphthylamine to three colloidal CNTs, including a stable suspension of oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (O-MWNT), a humic acid (HA)-modified colloidal O-MWNT, and a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-modified colloidal O-MWNT. All three colloidal O-MWNTs exhibit strong adsorption affinities to the three test compounds (with K(OC) values orders of magnitude greater than those of natural organic matter), likely resulting from strong nonhydrophobic interactions such as π-π electron donor-acceptor interactions and Lewis acid-base interactions. When thoroughly mixed, HA (at ∼310 mg HA/g CNT) and SDS (at ∼750 mg SDS/g CNT) significantly affected the aggregation properties of O-MWNT, causing individually dispersed tubes to form a loosely entangled network. The effects of HA or SDS modification on adsorption are twofold. Adsorption of HA/SDS significantly reduces surface areas of O-MWNT; however, the entangled network allows adsorbate molecules to interact simultaneously with multiple tubes. An important implication is that humic substances and surfactant-like materials not only facilitate the formation of colloidal carbon nanoparticles but also affect how these colloidal carbon nanoparticles adsorb organic contaminants.
16781459	Hydrogen sulfide inhibits nitric oxide production and nuclear factor-kappaB via heme oxygenase-1 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide.	Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), a regulatory gaseous molecule that is endogenously synthesized by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and/or cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) from L-cysteine (L-Cys) metabolism, is a putative vasodilator, and its role in nitric oxide (NO) production is unexplored. Here, we show that at noncytotoxic concentrations, H(2)S was able to inhibit NO production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression via heme oxygenase (HO-1) expression in RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both H(2)S solution prepared by bubbling pure H(2)S gas and NaSH, a H(2)S donor, dose dependently induced HO-1 expression through the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Pretreatment with H(2)S or NaHS significantly inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production. Moreover, NO production in LPS-stimulated macrophages that are expressing CSE mRNA was significantly reduced by the addition of L-Cys, a substrate for H(2)S, but enhanced by the selective CSE inhibitor beta-cyano-L-alanine but not by the CBS inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid. While either blockage of HO activity by the HO inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin IX, or down-regulation of HO-1 expression by HO-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the inhibitory effects of H(2)S on iNOS expression and NO production, HO-1 overexpression produced the same inhibitory effects of H(2)S. In addition, LPS-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation was diminished in RAW264.7 macrophages preincubated with H(2)S. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of H(2)S on NF-kappaB activation was reversed by the transient transfection with HO-1 siRNA, but was mimicked by either HO-1 gene transfection or treatment with carbon monoxide (CO), an end product of HO-1. CO treatment also inhibited LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression via its inactivation of NF-kappaB. Collectively, our results suggest that H(2)S can inhibit NO production and NF-kappaB activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages through a mechanism that involves the action of HO-1/CO.
18220763	Type 2 diabetes and oral antihyperglycemic drugs.	Type II diabetes is a heterogeneous disease where environment and genetics are important factors for the expression of the disease. The high cost for treating complications of diabetes is a burden for public health systems and governments worldwide. Type II diabetes has been causing debilitation worldwide for many decades, and a single drug that safely treats the disease has yet to be discovered. Sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase, meglitinides, DPP-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones are among the classes of oral hypoglycemic drugs available to treat Type II diabetes, but concerns exist regarding safety and efficacy of these drugs. In this article we present the pros and cons of the six classes and discuss some of the latest advances towards the development of new drugs for the treatment of Type II diabetes.
17260025	A chemical biology approach identifies a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that causes human tumor regression by blocking the Raf-1/Mek-1/Erk1/2 pathway.	A chemical biology approach identifies a beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) agonist ARA-211 (Pirbuterol), which causes apoptosis and human tumor regression in animal models. beta2AR stimulation of cAMP formation and protein kinase A (PKA) activation leads to Raf-1 (but not B-Raf) kinase inactivation, inhibition of Mek-1 kinase and decreased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 levels. ARA-211 inhibition of the Raf/Mek/Erk1/2 pathway is mediated by PKA and not exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC). ARA-211 is selective and suppresses P-Erk1/2 but not P-JNK, P-p38, P-Akt or P-STAT3 levels. beta2AR stimulation results in inhibition of anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, induction of apoptosis in vitro and tumor regression in vivo. beta2AR antagonists and constitutively active Mek-1 rescue from the effects of ARA-211, demonstrating that beta2AR stimulation and Mek kinase inhibition are required for ARA-211 antitumor activity. Furthermore, suppression of growth occurs only in human tumors where ARA-211 induces cAMP formation and decreases P-Erk1/2 levels. Thus, beta2AR stimulation results in significant suppression of malignant transformation in cancers where it blocks the Raf-1/Mek-1/Erk1/2 pathway by a cAMP-dependent activation of PKA but not EPAC.
12244074	TNF-alpha increases the carbohydrate sulfation of CD44: induction of 6-sulfo N-acetyl lactosamine on N- and O-linked glycans.	CD44 and sulfation have both been implicated in leukocyte adhesion. In monocytes, the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulates CD44 sulfation, and this correlates with the induction of CD44-mediated adhesion events. However, little is known about the sulfation of CD44 or its induction by inflammatory cytokines. We determined that TNF-alpha induces the carbohydrate sulfation of CD44. CD44 was established as a major sulfated cell surface protein on myeloid cells. In the SR91 myeloid cell line, the majority of CD44 sulfation was attributed to the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate. However, TNF-alpha stimulation increased CD44 sulfation two- to threefold, largely attributed to the increased sulfation of N- and O-linked glycans on CD44. Therefore, TNF-alpha induced a decrease in the percentage of CD44 sulfation due to chondroitin sulfate and an increase due to N- and O-linked sulfation. Furthermore, TNF-alpha induced the expression of 6-sulfo N-acetyl lactosamine (LacNAc)/Lewis x on these cells, which was detected by a monoclonal antibody after neuraminidase treatment. This 6-sulfo LacNAc/Lewis x epitope was induced on N-linked and (to a lesser extent) on O-linked glycans present on CD44. This demonstrates that CD44 is modified by sulfated carbohydrates in myeloid cells and that TNF-alpha modifies both the type and amount of carbohydrate sulfation occurring on CD44. In addition, it demonstrates that TNF-alpha can induce the expression of 6-sulfo N-acetyl glucosamine on both N- and O-linked glycans of CD44 in myeloid cells.
16916952	Bovine and ovine gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-II ligand precursors and type II GnRH receptor genes are functionally inactivated.	The decapeptide sequence of GnRH-II is conserved in all jawed vertebrate species studied to date. New data for cattle (Bos taurus) indicates a gene encoding GnRH-II decapeptide possessing arginine (codon: CGG) rather than tryptophan (TGG) at position three in the mature peptide. This substitution is unique. We confirmed the DNA sequence after cloning part of the bovine prepro-GnRH-II gene. Bovine GnRH-II peptide was synthesized and pharmacologically characterized. It did not bind to mammalian GnRH receptors expressed in different types of cell nor did it exhibit agonist or antagonist properties on types I or II GnRH receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Bovine primers facilitated cloning of ovine GnRH-II DNA. A premature stop codon (TGA) replaces the expected tryptophan codon at position seven of GnRH-II in sheep DNA. Thus, both species possess prepro-GnRH-II genes encoding inactive peptides, as previously described for chimpanzee GnRH-II. The updated bovine type II GnRH receptor gene sequence revealed inactivation by frame shifts, premature stop codons, and nucleotide changes specifying nonconservative replacement of amino acid residues, similar to inactivation of sheep type II GnRH receptor. Spliced RNA transcripts from the disrupted receptor gene were not detected in bovine pituitary. In contrast, bovine prepro-GnRH-I and type I GnRH receptor genes are intact, encoding well-conserved protein sequences. These findings, and previous descriptions of inactivation of the human type II GnRH receptor and deletions of prepro-GnRH-II and type II GnRH receptor in laboratory rodents, suggest the GnRH-II system has been replaced by the GnRH-I system or is redundant in certain mammals.
11587223	Sulfasalazine, a potent suppressor of lymphoma growth by inhibition of the x(c)- cystine transporter: a new action for an old drug.	Although cyst(e)ine is nutritionally a non-essential amino acid, lymphoid cells cannot synthesize it, rendering their growth dependent on uptake of cyst(e)ine from their microenvironment. Accordingly, we previously suggested that the x(c)- plasma membrane cystine transporter provided a target for lymphoid cancer therapy. Its inhibition could lead to cyst(e)ine deficiency in lymphoma cells via reduction of both their cystine uptake and cysteine supply by somatic cells. In this study, using rat Nb2 lymphoma cultures, drugs were screened for growth arrest based on x(c)- inhibition. Sulfasalazine was fortuitously found to be a novel, potent inhibitor of the x(c)- transporter. It showed high rat lymphoma growth-inhibitory and lytic activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.16 mM), based specifically on inhibition of x(c)--mediated cystine uptake, in contrast to its colonic metabolites, sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. Sulfasalazine was even more effective against human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DoHH2) cultures. In rats (n = 13), sulfasalazine (i.p.) markedly inhibited growth of well-developed, rapidly growing rat Nb2 lymphoma transplants without apparent side-effects. Reduced, macrophage-mediated supply of cysteine was probably involved. In five rats, 90-100% tumor growth suppression, relative to controls, was obtained. The x(c)- cystine transporter represents a novel target for sulfasalazine-like drugs with high potential for application in therapy of lymphoblastic and other malignancies dependent on extracellular cyst(e)ine.
12897089	Oxidative stress-related factors in Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes: relevance for angiotensin II signalling.	BACKGROUND: Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes (BS/GS) have a blunted Gq protein-mediated cell signalling despite high circulating angiotensin II (Ang II) levels. This is associated with reduced Galphaq gene expression, intracellular inositol trisphosphate and Ca(++) release, PKC activity and cell reactivity. Ang II is a powerful stimulator of vascular oxidases but BS/GS patients show reduced total volatile LDL oxidation products and reduced LDL susceptibility to oxidation suggesting low level of oxidative stress. Therefore, we evaluated oxidative stress-related proteins in plasma and monocytes of patients with BS/GS, at baseline and after Ang II stimulation. METHODS: In two BS and seven GS patients, biochemically and genetically characterized, and in 10 age- and sex-matched control subjects, we measured total plasma antioxidant power (AOP), plasma peroxynitrite level and gene expression of the NADH/NADPH oxidase subunit p22(phox), TGFbeta and haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in circulating monocytes in basal condition and after stimulation with Ang II. Furthermore, we investigated the C(242)T polymorphism of p22(phox), whose topography in a potential haeme-binding site suggests a role in the regulation of oxidative stress. RESULTS: AOP was higher in BS/GS patients than in controls (3.27 +/- 0.95 mmol/l vs 1.05 +/- 0.16, P = 0.002), together with higher plasma renin activity and aldosterone level (9.88 +/- 4.64 vs 0.95 +/- 0.08 nmol Ang I/h/ml, P < 0.0001; and 0.73 +/- 0.13 vs 0.18 +/- 0.01 nmol/l, P < 0.0001, respectively). The plasma peroxynitrite level was undetectable both in patients and controls. mRNA expression of p22(phox) and TGFbeta was reduced in BS/GS patients compared to controls [0.35 +/- 0.08 vs 0.53+/-0.05 densitometric units (d.u.), P = 0.005, and 0.82 +/- 0.07 vs 1.15 +/- 0.25 d.u., P = 0.006, respectively]. HO-1 mRNA was increased in BS/GS patients in comparison to controls (0.88 +/- 0.07 vs 0.78 +/- 0.11 d.u., P = 0.037). After acute Ang II exposure, p22(phox), TGFbeta and HO-1 gene expression significantly increased only in controls (from 0.59 +/- 0.12 to 0.96 +/- 0.11, P < 0.001, from 0.97 +/- 0.1 to 1.27 +/- 0.22, P < 0.008, and from 0.62 +/- 0.1 to 0.82 +/- 0.09, P < 0.001, respectively). Finally, C(242)T polymorphism of p22(phox) was undetectable. CONCLUSIONS: The intracellular responses to Ang II mediated by reactive oxygen species are reduced in BS/GS patients. This may contribute to their vascular hyporeactivity.
23581551	Design, Synthesis, and Structure-Activity Relationship Studies of Novel 3-Alkylindole Derivatives as Selective and Highly Potent Myeloperoxidase Inhibitors.	Due to its production of potent antimicrobial oxidants including hypochlorous acid, human myeloperoxidase (MPO) plays a critical role in innate immunity and inflammatory diseases. Thus MPO is an attractive target in drug design. (Aminoalkyl)fluoroindole derivatives were detected to be very potent MPO inhibitors; however, they also promote inhibition of the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) at the same concentration range. Via structure-based drug design, a new series of MPO inhibitors derived from 3-alkylindole were synthesized and their effects were assessed on MPO-mediated taurine chlorination and low-density lipoprotein oxidation as well as on inhibition of SERT. The fluoroindole compound with three carbons in the side chain and one amide group exhibited a selectivity index of 35 (Ki/IC50) with high inhibition of MPO activity (IC50 = 18 nM), whereas its effect on SERT was in the micromolar range. Structure-function relationships, mechanism of action, and safety of the molecule are discussed.
18465538	Flavopiridol Hoechst AG.	Hoechst is developing flavopiridol, a synthetic flavonoid based on an extract from an Indian plant, for the potential treatment of cancer. Flavopiridol, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, arrests cell division and causes apoptosis in non-small lung cancer cells [283660]. A phase II trial, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, has commenced at the University of Chicago Medical Center, which involves patients with high or intermediate-grade lymphoma or multiple myeloma [272937], [277372]. In ex vivo experiments with tumor cells from refractory chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, dose-dependent CDK2 inhibition associated with apoptotic changes was seen at concentrations greater than 100 nM of flavopiridol. In vitro pharmacokinetic studies have shown that flavopiridol undergoes hepatic biotransformation to its corresponding glucoronide by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases [283791]. Flavopiridol inhibits CDK with an IC50 value of 0.4 mM [285707]. Preclinical toxicology studies in rats and dogs demonstrated dose-related leukopenia and drug-related lesions in the thymus, spleen and bone marrow. The gastrointestinal and bone marrow toxicity was dose-limiting [178579]. Hoechst Marion Roussel expects to launch flavopiridol in the year 2001, with potential sales in excess of DM 750 million [288651].
23389862	Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors augment the ability of formoterol to enhance glucocorticoid-dependent gene transcription in human airway epithelial cells: a novel mechanism for the clinical efficacy of roflumilast in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Post-hoc analysis of two phase III clinical studies found that the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, roflumilast, reduced exacerbation frequency in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) concomitantly, whereas patients not taking ICS derived no such benefit. In contrast, in two different trials also performed in patients with severe COPD, roflumilast reduced exacerbation rates in the absence of ICS, indicating that PDE4 inhibition alone is sufficient for therapeutic activity to be realized. Given that roflumilast is recommended as an "add-on" medication to patients with severe disease who will inevitably be taking a long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA)/ICS combination therapy, we tested the hypothesis that roflumilast augments the ability of glucocorticoids to induce genes with anti-inflammatory activity. Using a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) luciferase reporter transfected into human airway epithelial cells [both bronchial epithelium + adenovirus 12 - SV40 hybrid (BEAS-2B) cells and primary cultures], roflumilast enhanced fluticasone propionate-induced GRE-dependent transcription. Roflumilast also produced a sinistral displacement of the concentration-response curves that described the augmentation of GRE-dependent transcription by the LABA formoterol. In BEAS-2B cells and primary airway epithelia, roflumilast interacted with formoterol in a positive cooperative manner to enhance the expression of several glucocorticoid-inducible genes that have anti-inflammatory potential. We suggest that the ability of roflumilast and formoterol to interact in this way supports the concept that these drugs together may impart clinical benefit beyond that achievable by an ICS alone, a PDE4 inhibitor alone, or an ICS/LABA combination therapy. Roflumilast may, therefore, be especially effective in patients with severe COPD.
9056052	Initial human experience with MK-462 (rizatriptan): a novel 5-HT1D agonist.	AIMS: We evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral MK-462 in comparison with oral sumatriptan in healthy male volunteers. METHODS: Sixteen healthy male volunteers were studied in a rising, single dose, alternating panel design with eight subjects per panel. Matching placebo was administered to two of eight study subjects at each dose level of MK-462 in a randomized, double-blind fashion. RESULTS: MK-462 was rapidly absorbed with a median tmax of 1.3 h (range 1-3 h) vs a tmax for sumatriptan of 2.5 h (range 1-4 h, P < 0.001). Administration of either MK-462 or sumatriptan produced maximal mean elevations of 5-10 mmHg in systolic and diastolic blood pressures without effect on heart rate; the changes occurred sooner following MK-462, consistent with more rapid absorption. Both MK-462 and sumatriptan provoked mild increases in serum growth hormone without any effect on serum prolactin concentrations. The most commonly reported symptom following MK-462 was drowsiness. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the novel 5-HT1D agonist, MK-462, is rapidly absorbed following oral administration and warrants further investigation of its utility in the treatment of acute migraine.
12504917	Pharmacological properties of the anti-Parkinson drug rasagiline; modification of endogenous brain amines, reserpine reversal, serotonergic and dopaminergic behaviours.	Rasagiline [N-propargyl-1R(+)-aminoindan; TVP1012] is a potent irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor with selectivity for type B of the enzyme, which is being developed for treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this study we examined effects of rasagiline on CNS monoamine levels, modification of behavioural response to L-tryptophan, fluoxetine and L-DOPA, and reversal of reserpine syndrome. Reserpine-induced ptosis was reversed by rasagiline at doses above 2 mg x kg(-1) i.p., which inhibit MAO-A as well as MAO-B, but not at MAO-B-selective doses. However, combination of rasagiline (10 mg x kg(-1) i.p.) with L-DOPA or L-tryptophan (50 mg x kg(-1) i.p.), or rasagiline (10 mg x kg(-1) p.o.) with fluoxetine (10 mg x kg(-1) p.o.), did not induce the behavioural hyperactivity syndrome which is seen following inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B by tranylcypromine together with the monoamine precursors. Following oral administration, levels of noradrenaline (NA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) were unaffected in hippocampus and striatum after single doses of rasagiline up to 2 mg x kg(-1). Following chronic oral administration (21 days, one dose daily), levels of NA, 5-HT and DA in hippocampus and striatum were unaffected by rasagiline at doses up to 1 mg x kg(-1). Rasagiline does not modify CNS monoamine tissue levels or monoamine-induced behavioural syndromes at doses which selectively inhibit MAO-B but not MAO-A.
23384447	Northern contaminant mixtures induced morphological and functional changes in human coronary artery endothelial cells under culture conditions typifying high fat/sugar diet and ethanol exposure.	It has been reported that Northern populations are exposed to mixtures of various environmental contaminants unique to the Arctic (Northern contaminant mixtures - NCM) at a large range of concentrations, depending on their geological location, age, lifestyle and dietary habits. To determine if these contaminants may contribute to a cardiovascular health risk, especially when combined with a high fat and sugar diet and ethanol exposure, we treated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) with two mixtures of 4 organic (NCM1) or 22 organic and inorganic (NCM2) chemicals detected in Northerners' blood during 2004-2005 in the presence or absence of low-density lipoprotein (1.5mg/ml), very-low-density lipoprotein (1.0mg/ml) and glucose (10mmol/L) (LVG), and in the absence or presence of 0.1% ethanol. After 24h of exposure, cell morphology and markers of cytotoxicity and endothelial function were examined. NCM1 treatment did not affect cell viability, but increased cell size, disrupted cell membrane integrity, and decreased cell density, uptake of small peptides, release of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), while causing no changes in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression and nitric oxide (NO) release. In contrast, NCM2 decreased cell viability, total protein yield, uptake of small peptides, eNOS protein expression, and NO release and caused membrane damage, but caused no changes in the secretion of ET-1, prostacyclin and PAI. The presence of LVG and/or alcohol did or did not influence the effects of NCM1 or NCM2 depending on the endpoint and the mixture examined. These results suggested that the effects of one or one group of contaminants may be altered by the presence of other contaminants, and that with or without the interaction of high fat and sugar diet and/or ethanol exposure, NCMs at the concentrations used caused endothelial dysfunction in vitro. It remains to be investigated if these effects of NCMs also occur in vivo.
23122079	Phillyrin attenuates high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes through the activation of LKB1/AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent signalling.	Phillyrin, an active constituent found in many medicinal plants and certain functional foods, has anti-obesity activity in vivo. The aim of our study was to provide new data on the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the role of phillyrin in the prevention of high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes. We found that phillyrin suppressed high glucose-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Phillyrin strongly inhibited high glucose-induced fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression by modulating sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) activation. Moreover, use of the pharmacological AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C revealed that AMPK is essential for suppressing SREBP-1c expression in phillyrin-treated cells. Finally, we found that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) phosphorylation is required for the phillyrin-enhanced activation of AMPK in HepG2 hepatocytes. These results indicate that phillyrin prevents lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells by blocking the expression of SREBP-1c and FAS through LKB1/AMPK activation, suggesting that phillyrin is a novel AMPK activator with a role in the prevention and treatment of obesity.
23194529	The presence of D-fagomine in the human diet from buckwheat-based foodstuffs.	Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) groats contain the iminosugar D-fagomine as a minor component that might contribute to the alleged health benefits of this pseudo-cereal. This study presents analysis of D-fagomine in buckwheat-based foodstuffs by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and an estimation of its presence in the human diet based on a published population-based cross-sectional nutrition survey. D-fagomine is present in common buckwheat-based foodstuffs in amounts ranging from 1 to 25 mg/kg or mg/L, it is stable during boiling, baking, frying and fermentation, and it is biosynthesised upon sprouting. The estimated total intake of D-fagomine resulting from a diet that includes such foodstuffs would be between 3 and 17 mg per day (mean for both genders; range from P5 to P95). A diet rich in buckwheat products would provide a daily amount of D-fagomine that may in part explain the beneficial properties traditionally attributed to buckwheat consumption.
23512824	Recruiting the Host's Immune System to Target Helicobacter pylori's Surface Glycans.	Due to the increased prevalence of bacterial strains that are resistant to existing antibiotics, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial strategies. Bacterial glycans are an attractive target for new treatments, as they are frequently linked to pathogenesis and contain distinctive structures that are absent in humans. We set out to develop a novel targeting strategy based on surface glycans present on the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp). In this study, metabolic labeling of bacterial glycans with an azide-containing sugar allowed selective delivery of immune stimulants to azide-covered Hp. We established that Hp's surface glycans are labeled by treatment with the metabolic substrate peracetylated N-azidoacetylglucosamine (Ac4 GlcNAz). By contrast, mammalian cells treated with Ac4 GlcNAz exhibited no incorporation of the chemical label within extracellular glycans. We further demonstrated that the Staudinger ligation between azides and phosphines proceeds under acidic conditions with only a small loss of efficiency. We then targeted azide-covered Hp with phosphines conjugated to the immune stimulant 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP), a compound capable of directing a host immune response against these cells. Finally, we report that immune effector cells catalyze selective damage in vitro to DNP-covered Hp in the presence of anti-DNP antibodies. The technology reported herein represents a novel strategy to target Hp based on its glycans.
9677387	58K, a microtubule-binding Golgi protein, is a formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase.	58K was previously identified as a rat liver protein that binds microtubules in vitro and is associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi apparatus in vivo (Bloom, G. S., and Brashear, T. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16083-16092). We now report that 58K is a formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD), a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two consecutive steps in the modification of tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyl tetrahydrofolate. Comparative immunoblotting using several monoclonal antibodies made against 58K and a polyclonal antibody made against a chicken liver protein (p60) with similar properties (Hennig, D., Scales, S. J., Moreau, A., Murley, L. L., De Mey, J., and Kreis, T. E. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 19602-19611) demonstrated precise co-purification of protein recognized by all antibodies through multiple fractionation steps, including gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Eight peptides derived from 58K showed high sequence identity to amino acid sequences predicted by full length cDNA for p60 and porcine liver FTCD. Furthermore, purified 58K was associated with formiminotransferase and cyclodeaminase activities. Based on these collective results, 58K was concluded to be a rat liver version of FTCD. Microtubules assembled from brain tubulin, but not from liver tubulin, were able to bind rat liver FTCD. Binding to brain microtubules is suspected to occur via polyglutamates that are added post-translationally to tubulin in brain, which was shown to contain very low levels of FTCD, but not to tubulin in liver, which was determined to be the richest tissue source, by far, of FTCD. The physiological significance of the microtubule binding activity of FTCD is thus called into question, but an association of FTCD with the Golgi apparatus has now been established.
23620660	Profile of certolizumab and its potential in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.	Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy associated with psoriasis (PsO). PsA could be considered an enthesal disease because of the link between mechanical stress (entheses) and immunologically active tissue (synovium). Evidence of efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is supported by reduction of histological vascularity and immune cell infiltrates in synovial tissue after treatment. Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a polyethylene glycolylated (PEGylated) Fab' fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes human TNF-alpha. The PEG moiety of the Fab fragment, markedly increases the half-life of CZP and confers to the drug a unique structure that differs from the other anti-TNF-alpha agents tested for the treatment of Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis, nonradiographic spondyloarthritis, PsO, and PsA. In contrast to other anti-TNF-alpha agents, CZP did not mediate increased levels of apoptosis, suggesting that these mechanisms are not essential for the anti-TNF-alpha efficacy in Crohn's disease. As CZP, infliximab, and adalimumab, but not etanercept, almost completely inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta release from monocytes, this cytokine-production inhibition may be relevant for drug efficacy. Due to these characteristics, it has been demonstrated in clinical studies that CZP effectively improves signs and symptoms of arthritis and physical function and skin manifestations of PsO, with a safety profile similar to rheumatoid arthritis. This drug can be considered as a valid treatment in patients affected by PsA. The efficacy and tolerability profiles suggest CZP as a suitable antipsoriatic drug in the treatment of PsA.
23468189	Benzenesulfonamides: a unique class of chemokine receptor type 4 inhibitors.	The interaction of CXCR4 with CXCL12 (SDF-1) plays a critical role in cancer metastasis by facilitating the homing of tumor cells to metastatic sites. Based on our previously published work on CXCR4 antagonists, we have synthesized a series of aryl sulfonamides that inhibit the CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction. Analogue bioactivities were assessed with binding affinity and Matrigel invasion assays. Computer modeling was employed to evaluate a selection of the new analogues docked into the CXCR4 X-ray structure and to rationalize discrepancies between the affinity and Matrigel in vitro assays. A lead compound displays nanomolar potency in the binding affinity assay (IC(50)=8.0 nM) and the Matrigel invasion assay (100 % blockade of invasion at 10 nM). These data demonstrate that benzenesulfonamides are a unique class of CXCR4 inhibitors with high potency.
23419388	Danshen mediates through estrogen receptors to activate Akt and inhibit apoptosis effect of Leu27IGF-II-induced IGF-II receptor signaling activation in cardiomyoblasts.	Post-menopausal women show dramatically increased cardiovascular disease morbidity (CVD). Danshen is used widely in China for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, including coronary heart disease. Danshen possesses lipid-soluble biologically active components with a structure similar to 17β-estrodiol (E2). This study assesses whether the cardio-protection exerted by Danshen is mediated through the ERs within H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. Cardiomyoblast cells pretreated with Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780), an estrogen receptor antagonist was applied to investigate the estrogenic activity of Danshen. The Danshen extract preventive effects on Leu27IGF-II-induced IGF-IIR signaling activator and H9c2 cell apoptosis were identified using TUNEL assay, JC-1 staining and Western blot assay. We found that Danshen extract treatments significantly enhanced phosphorylated Akt through estrogen receptor activation to inhibit Leu27IGF-II-induced calcineurin activation and block H9c2 cell apoptosis. Danshen extracts suppressed the IGF-IIR signaling proteins, pro-apoptotic proteins and reversed the mitochondrial membrane instability induced by Leu27IGF-II. However, the cardioprotective properties of Danshen to inhibit Leu27IGF-II-induced cell apoptosis and promote cell survival were attenuated by applying ICI, which suggests that the Danshen cardioprotective effect is mediated through estrogen receptors. All our data indicated that Danshen exerts strong estrogenic activity which can be considered a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) against IGF2R signaling that blocks cardiac apoptosis.
21143836	ASIC3 channels integrate agmatine and multiple inflammatory signals through the nonproton ligand sensing domain.	BACKGROUND: Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) have long been known to sense extracellular protons and contribute to sensory perception. Peripheral ASIC3 channels represent natural sensors of acidic and inflammatory pain. We recently reported the use of a synthetic compound, 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ), to identify a novel nonproton sensing domain in the ASIC3 channel, and proposed that, based on its structural similarity with GMQ, the arginine metabolite agmatine (AGM) may be an endogenous nonproton ligand for ASIC3 channels. RESULTS: Here, we present further evidence for the physiological correlation between AGM and ASIC3. Among arginine metabolites, only AGM and its analog arcaine (ARC) activated ASIC3 channels at neutral pH in a sustained manner similar to GMQ. In addition to the homomeric ASIC3 channels, AGM also activated heteromeric ASIC3 plus ASIC1b channels, extending its potential physiological relevance. Importantly, the process of activation by AGM was highly sensitive to mild acidosis, hyperosmolarity, arachidonic acid (AA), lactic acid and reduced extracellular Ca2+. AGM-induced ASIC3 channel activation was not through the chelation of extracellular Ca2+ as occurs with increased lactate, but rather through a direct interaction with the newly identified nonproton ligand sensing domain. Finally, AGM cooperated with the multiple inflammatory signals to cause pain-related behaviors in an ASIC3-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Nonproton ligand sensing domain might represent a novel mechanism for activation or sensitization of ASIC3 channels underlying inflammatory pain-sensing under in vivo conditions.
23414292	Bifunctional electrophiles cross-link thioredoxins with redox relay partners in cells.	Thioredoxin protects cells against oxidative damage by reducing disulfide bonds in improperly oxidized proteins. Previously, we found that the baker's yeast cytosolic thioredoxin Trx2 undergoes cross-linking to form several protein-protein complexes in cells treated with the bifunctional electrophile divinyl sulfone (DVSF). Here, we report that the peroxiredoxin Tsa1 and the thioredoxin reductase Trr1, both of which function in a redox relay network with thioredoxin, become cross-linked in complexes with Trx2 upon DVSF treatment. Treatment of yeast with other bifunctional electrophiles, including diethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DAD), mechlorethamine (HN2), and 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), resulted in the formation of similar cross-linked complexes. Cross-linking of Trx2 and Tsa1 to other proteins by DVSF and DAD is dependent on modification of the active site Cys residues within these proteins. In addition, the human cytosolic thioredoxin, cytosolic thioredoxin reductase, and peroxiredoxin 2 form cross-linked complexes to other proteins in the presence of DVSF, although each protein shows different susceptibilities to modification by DAD, HN2, and DEB. Taken together, our results indicate that bifunctional electrophiles potentially disrupt redox homeostasis in yeast and human cells by forming cross-linked complexes between thioredoxins and their redox partners.
15689518	Crystal structure of the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent serine dehydratase from human liver.	L-serine dehydratase (SDH), a member of the beta-family of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent (PLP) enzymes, catalyzes the deamination of L-serine and L-threonine to yield pyruvate or 2-oxobutyrate. The crystal structure of L-serine dehydratase from human liver (hSDH) has been solved at 2.5 A-resolution by molecular replacement. The structure is a homodimer and reveals a fold typical for beta-family PLP-dependent enzymes. Each monomer serves as an active unit and is subdivided into two distinct domains: a small domain and a PLP-binding domain that covalently anchors the cofactor. Both domains show the typical open alpha/beta architecture of PLP enzymes. Comparison with the rSDH-(PLP-OMS) holo-enzyme reveals a large structural difference in active sites caused by the artifical O-methylserine. Furthermore, the activity of hSDH-PLP was assayed and it proved to show catalytic activity. That suggests that the structure of hSDH-PLP is the first structure of the active natural holo-SDH.
10823899	Amphetamine-induced loss of human dopamine transporter activity: an internalization-dependent and cocaine-sensitive mechanism.	The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a target of amphetamine (AMPH) and cocaine. These psychostimulants attenuate DAT clearance efficiency, thereby increasing synaptic dopamine (DA) levels. Re-uptake rate is determined by the number of functional transporters at the cell surface as well as by their turnover rate. Here, we present evidence that DAT substrates, including AMPH and DA, cause internalization of human DAT, thereby reducing transport capacity. Acute treatment with AMPH reduced the maximal rate of [(3)H]DA uptake, decreased AMPH-induced currents, and significantly redistributed the immunofluorescence of an epitope-tagged DAT from the plasma membrane to the cytosol in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Conversely, DAT inhibitors, such as cocaine, mazindol, and nomifensine, when administered with AMPH, blocked the reduction in [(3)H]DA uptake and the redistribution of DAT immunofluorescence to the cytosol. The reductions of [(3)H]DA uptake and AMPH-induced DAT internalization also were inhibited by coexpression of a dominant negative mutant of dynamin I (K44A), indicating that endocytosis modulates transport capacity, likely through a clathrin-mediated pathway. With this mechanism of regulation, acute application of AMPH would reduce DA uptake not only by direct competition for uptake, but also by reducing the available cell-surface DAT. Moreover, AMPH-induced internalization might diminish the amount of DAT available for DA efflux, thereby modulating the cytotoxic effects of elevated extracellular DA.
15673388	Further insights into the effect of quinidine in short QT syndrome caused by a mutation in HERG.	INTRODUCTION: The principal aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of quinidine in suppressing IKr in vitro and in modulating the rate dependence of the QT interval in the "SQT1" form of the short QT syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Graded-intensity bicycle exercise testing was performed off drug in three patients and during oral quinidine in two patients with short QT syndrome and compared to a control group of healthy normal subjects. The in vitro effects of quinidine on currents in patch clamp technique were investigated. Off drugs QTpV3/heart rate correlation is much weaker in patients with short QT syndrome, and QTpV3 shortens less with heart rate increase compared to normal subjects. In addition to prolonging the QT interval into the normal range, quinidine restored the heart rate dependence of the QT interval toward a range of adaptation reported for normal subjects. Data from heterologous expression of wild-type and mutant HERG genes indicate the mutation causes a 20-fold increase in IC50 of d-sotalol but only a 5.8-fold increase in IC50 of quinidine. CONCLUSION: Oral quinidine is effective in suppressing the gain of function in IKr responsible for some cases of short QT syndrome with a mutation in HERG and thus restoring normal rate dependence of the QT interval and rendering ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation noninducible.
15206110	Gallium and other main group metal compounds as antitumor agents.	Gallium has been the second metal to show activity against malignant tumors in humans soon after the establishment of platinum drugs in routine clinical practice. It has the unique property of inhibiting tumor growth as a simple cation, mainly because of its close resemblance to ferric iron. Even though its inability to shift between the trivalent and a divalent oxidation state precludes that gallium behaves as an iron analogue in every respect, it strongly interferes with cellular acquisition of iron from blood by competitive interaction with transferrin and transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, gallium also seems to affect intracellular availability of iron already taken up via this pathway, probably due to its inhibitory activity on vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPases. Apart from the consequences of iron deprivation, gallium exerts cytotoxic effects by direct interaction with the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in reduced dNTP pools and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Both the abundance of transferrin receptors and upregulation of ribonucleotide reductase render tumors susceptible to gallium-induced cytotoxicity. However, some experimental findings raise the question whether these effects resulting from the iron-mimicking properties of gallium are solely responsible for its antineoplastic activity or whether additional mechanisms are involved, such as antimitotic effects which result from its capability of inhibiting tubulin polymerization. The limitations experienced with gallium nitrate and gallium chloride, which call for a prolonged exposure to low steady-state gallium levels in blood in order to adequately exploit the affinity of gallium to tumor tissues and to avoid severe toxic effects, may be overcome by oral gallium complexes such as tris(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-onato)gallium(III) (gallium maltolate) or tris(8-quinolinolato)gallium(III) (KP46), which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and show promise to initiate a revival of gallium in the clinical setting. These two investigational drugs, albeit differing in their complex stability, have both been developed with the intention of providing gallium in a form which allows sufficient intestinal absorption, but without altering its pharmacodynamic effects. Gallium complexes based on other rationales are scarce and, with regard to the well-known antineoplastic potential of this metal, noticeably under-explored. With the recent approval of arsenic trioxide for the second-line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, the clinical revival of arsenic compounds, which have been the mainstay of antileukemic therapy before the age of modern cancer chemotherapy, has already begun. Currently, strong efforts are being made to explore the activity spectrum in other (less rare) malignancies and to gain a deeper insight into the mode of action. Although this development is currently focusing on arsenic trioxide, it should be suited to stimulate investigations into the therapeutic potential of other arsenic compounds as well.
18336310	The development of topically acting carbonic anhydrase inhibitors as antiglaucoma agents.	Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) isoforms present in the eyes (CA I, II, IV and XII), with sulfonamides such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide and dichlorophenamide, is still widely used for the systemic treatment of glaucoma. The mechanism of action of these drugs consists in inhibition of CA isozymes present in ciliary processes of the eye, with the consequent reduction of bicarbonate and aqueous humour secretion, and of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) characteristic of this disease. As isoforms CA II/IV/XII are present in many other tissues/organs, generally, systemic CAIs possess undesired side effects such as numbness and tingling of extremities; metallic taste; depression; fatigue; malaise; weight loss; decreased libido; gastrointestinal irritation; metabolic acidosis; renal calculi and transient myopia. For avoiding these side effects, recently, topically effective CAIs have been developed in the last 10 years, with two drugs available clinically: dorzolamide and brinzolamide. Both these drugs are applied topically as water solutions/suspensions, alone or in combination with other agents (beta-blockers, prostaglandin derivatives, etc) and produce a consistent and prolonged reduction of IOP. Furthermore, recent reports show both the systemically as well as topically acting sulfonamide CAIs to be effective in the treatment of macular edema, macular degeneration disease, or diabetic retinopathy, for which pharmacological treatment is unavailable up to now. Much research is in act in the search of more effective topically acting CAIs, free of the inconveniences and side effects of the presently available drugs. For achieving this goal, two recently reported strategy, the tail approach and its variant, the sugar-tail approach, were extensively applied for the synthesis of large numbers of derivatives possessing desired physico-chemical properties. Many such new sulfonamides showed promising antiglaucoma activity in animal models of the disease.
23494944	Influence of the Green Tea Leaf Extract on Neurotoxicity of Aluminium Chloride in Rats.	Aluminium may have an important role in the aetiology/pathogenesis/precipitation of Alzheimer's disease. Because green tea (Camellia sinensis L.) reportedly has health-promoting effects in the central nervous system, we evaluated the effects of green tea leaf extract (GTLE) on aluminium chloride (AlCl3 ) neurotoxicity in rats. All solutions were injected into the cornu ammonis region 1 hippocampal region. We measured the performance of active avoidance (AA) tasks, various enzyme activities and total glutathione content (TGC) in the forebrain cortex (FbC), striatum, basal forebrain (BFb), hippocampus, brain stem and cerebellum. AlCl3 markedly reduced AA performance and activities of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in all regions. It decreased TGC in the FbC, striatum, BFb, hippocampus, brain stem and cerebellum, and increased superoxide dismutase activity in the FbC, cerebellum and BFb. GTLE pretreatment completely reversed the damaging effects of AlCl3 on AA and superoxide dismutase activity, markedly corrected COX and AChE activities, and moderately improved TGC. GTLE alone increased COX and AChE activities in almost all regions. GTLE reduces AlCl3 neurotoxicity probably via antioxidative effects and improves mitochondrial and cholinergic synaptic functions through the actions of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and (-)-epicatechin, compounds most abundantly found in GTLE. Our results suggest that green tea might be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
23210776	New molecular and cellular targets for chemoprevention and treatment of skin tumors by plant polyphenols: a critical review.	As the incidence of skin tumors has been steadily growing, there is an urgent need for the preventive measures as well as the improved therapeutic approaches. In the last two decades, natural plant derived polyphenols (PPs, resveratrol, silibinin, green tea polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, etc.) have been drawing particular interest as emerging active substances in dermatological/cosmeceutical compositions for the prevention, slowing, or reversion of skin tumorigenesis (chemoprevention). When chronically applied to the skin, they supposedly would not damage normal skin cells or negatively affect their functions while they would suppress tumorigenic cell transformation, inhibit tumor cell proliferation, and activate tumor cell apoptosis. PPs are also reported to synergize with conventional anti-cancer therapies. The major aim of this critical review is to provide recent updates on the molecular and cellular targets for the prevention and therapy of skin tumors with a special focus on the crossroad between inflammation and carcinogenesis as the most promising approach to chemoprevention. Novel therapeutic targets as different as epidermal stem cells, cellular senescence, epigenetic enzymes involved in carcinogenesis, epidermal growth factor and aryl hydrocarbon receptors, and metabolic CYP1 subfamily enzymes are highlighted. The mechanisms of PPs interaction with these molecular and cellular targets are reviewed. The feasibility of PPs to prevent/ cure specific cutaneous toxicity connected to anti-EGFR therapy and to reduce multidrug resistance of skin tumors is also discussed.
11839626	Clinical and molecular heterogeneity in the Brugada syndrome: a novel gene locus on chromosome 3.	BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome is a form of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation characterized by a right bundle-branch block pattern and ST elevation (STE) in the right precordial leads of the ECG. Sodium channel blockers increase STE. Mutations of the cardiac sodium channel SCN5A cause the disorder, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is often recommended for affected individuals. Mutations in other genes have not been identified, and it is not known if the efficacy of drug testing or the malignancy of arrhythmias correlates to the gene defect. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed histories, physical examinations, ECGs, and drug testing on a large multigenerational family with Brugada syndrome. DNA isolated from blood samples, polymorphic genomic markers, and polymorphisms within candidate sodium channels were used for a genome-wide screen, fine mapping, and linkage analysis. We identified 12 affected individuals (right bundle-branch block, > or =1-mm STE) with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern characterized by incomplete penetrance that appeared to be dependent on age and sex. Four affected individuals had syncope and 2 had documented ventricular arrhythmias, but there was minimal family history of sudden death. Procainamide infusions did not identify additional affected individuals. Linkage was present to an approximately equal 15-cM region on chromosome 3p22-25 (maximum LOD score=4.00). The sodium channel genes SCN5A, SCN10A, and SCN12A on chromosome 3 were excluded as candidates (LOD scores < or =-2). CONCLUSIONS: A Brugada syndrome locus distinct from SCN5A is associated with progressive conduction disease, a low sensitivity to procainamide testing, and a relatively good prognosis in a single large pedigree.
17394052	Dopamine genes and pathological gambling in discordant sib-pairs.	Pathological gambling (PG) is an impulse control disorder that has been considered as a behavioral addiction. Recent studies have suggested the involvement of the dopaminergic system in addictions and impulse control disorders and associations of dopamine receptor genes (DRD1, DRD2, and DRD4) and PG have been reported. In the present study, 140 sib-pairs discordant for the diagnosis of PG (70 males and 70 females on each group) were recruited through the Gambling Outpatient Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry, University of Sao Paulo and were assessed by trained psychiatrists. A family-based association design was chosen to prevent population stratification. All subjects were genotyped for dopamine receptor genes (DRD1 -800 T/C, DRD2 TaqIA RFLP, DRD3 Ser9Gly, DRD4 48bp exon III VNTR, DRD5 (CA) repeat) and the dopamine transporter gene (SCL6A3 40 bp VNTR). Our results suggest the association of PG with DRD1 -800 T/C allele T (P = .03).
23461378	Dissecting the relative contribution of OATP1B1-mediated uptake of xenobiotics into human hepatocytes using siRNA.	Abstract 1. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 plays a pivotal role in the disposition of many anionic drugs. Significant overlap in substrate specificity between individual OATP isoforms has hampered the identification of the relative importance of individual isoforms for hepatic uptake of xenobiotics. 2. The present study focused on the use of siRNA technology to decrease OATP1B1 selectively in human hepatocytes. Following delivery of siRNA by the novel lipid, AtuFECT01, mRNA expression of OATP1B1 was reduced by 94%-98% with no significant toxicity. Off-target effects were also shown to be minimal as evidenced by the expression of common drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, nuclear receptors and associated co-regulators. Uptake of estrone-3-sulfate (5 nM) by OATP1B1 was reduced by 82%-95%. This methodology was subsequently used to assess the relative contribution of OATP1B1 uptake in human hepatocytes for olmesartan (42%-62%), valsartan (28%-81%), rosuvastatin (64%-72%), pitavastatin (84%-98%) and lopinavir (64%-89%). These data are consistent with previous values obtained using a relative activity factor approach. 3. The siRNA approach provides a robust and reproducible method for assessing the relative contribution of OATP1B1 to hepatic uptake of new chemical entities. The technique also has potential utility in facilitating detailed characterization of drug-drug interactions involving hepatic drug transporters.
17664139	Sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter isoforms in skin: Distribution, kinetics, and effect of UVB-induced oxidative stress.	Two sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter isoforms (SVCT1 and SVCT2) were identified as ascorbic acid transporters, but their roles in skin have, as yet, not been elucidated. Here we analyze the expression and function of SVCTs in healthy human skin cells and skin tissues, and in UVB-induced cutaneous tissue injury. SVCT1 was primarily found in the epidermis expressed by keratinocytes, whereas SVCT2 expression was in the epidermis and dermis in keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Uptake experiments revealed that ascorbic acid affinity of SVCT1 was lower than SVCT2 (K(m)=75 muM and K(m)=44 muM, respectively), but maximal velocity was 9-times higher (36 nmol/min/well). In keratinocytes, SVCT1 was found to be responsible for vitamin C transport, although SVCT2 gene expression was higher. On UVB irradiation, SVCT1 mRNA expression in murine skin declined significantly in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas SVCT2 mRNA levels were unchanged. Furthermore, UVB irradiation of keratinocytes in vitro was accompanied by reduced ascorbic acid transport. In summary, these data indicate that the two vitamin C transporter isoforms fulfill specific functions in skin: SVCT1 is responsible for epidermal ascorbic acid supply, whereas SVCT2 mainly facilitates ascorbic acid transport in the dermal compartment. UVB-induced oxidative stress in mice resulted in depletion of SVCT1 mRNA levels and led to significantly decreased ascorbic acid uptake in keratinocytes, providing evidence on why ascorbic acid levels are decreased on UVB irradiation in vivo.
22935616	Noncanonical control of C. elegans germline apoptosis by the insulin/IGF-1 and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways.	The insulin/IGF-1 pathway controls a number of physiological processes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, including development, aging and stress response. We previously found that the Akt/PKB ortholog AKT-1 dampens the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress in the germline by negatively regulating the p53-like transcription factor CEP-1. Here, we report unexpected rearrangements to the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, whereby the insulin-like receptor DAF-2 and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK-1 oppose AKT-1 to promote DNA damage-induced apoptosis. While DNA damage does not affect phosphorylation at the PDK-1 site Thr350/Thr308 of AKT-1, it increased phosphorylation at Ser517/Ser473. Although ablation of daf-2 or pdk-1 completely suppressed akt-1-dependent apoptosis, the transcriptional activation of CEP-1 was unaffected, suggesting that daf-2 and pdk-1 act independently or downstream of cep-1 and akt-1. Ablation of the akt-1 paralog akt-2 or the downstream target of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway daf-16 (a FOXO transcription factor) restored sensitivity to damage-induced apoptosis in daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants. In addition, daf-2 and pdk-1 mutants have reduced levels of phospho-MPK-1/ERK in their germ cells, indicating that the insulin/IGF-1 pathway promotes Ras signaling in the germline. Ablation of the Ras effector gla-3, a negative regulator of mpk-1, restored sensitivity to apoptosis in daf-2 mutants, suggesting that gla-3 acts downstream of daf-2. In addition, the hypersensitivity of let-60/Ras gain-of-function mutants to damage-induced apoptosis was suppressed to wild-type levels by ablation of daf-2. Thus, insulin/IGF-1 signaling selectively engages AKT-2/DAF-16 to promote DNA damage-induced germ cell apoptosis downstream of CEP-1 through the Ras pathway.
10598120	Vasopeptidase inhibition with omapatrilat improves cardiac geometry and survival in cardiomyopathic hamsters more than does ACE inhibition with captopril.	Vasopeptidase inhibitors are single molecules that inhibit neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) simultaneously. Omapatrilat, the first in this new class of cardiovascular agents, potentiates vasodilatory and cardioprotective peptides and represses angiotensin II. This study compared the effects of omapatrilat with those of a pure ACE inhibitor on cardiac geometry and survival in animals with heart failure. BIO TO-2 cardiomyopathic hamsters (CMHs) in the early stages of dilated heart failure were treated with vehicle or maximal ACE inhibitory doses of captopril (750 micromol/kg/day) or omapatrilat (200 micromol/kg/day). Prolonged vasopeptidase inhibition increased median survival time after the start of treatment by 99 and 31% compared with vehicle and captopril, respectively (median survival times: 146, 221, and 290 days with vehicle, captopril, and omapatrilat, respectively; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). In similar CMHs, captopril or omapatrilat administered for 2 months significantly (p < 0.05) decreased heart weight, pulmonary congestion (lung weight), and left ventricular (LV) chamber volume compared with vehicle. Omapatrilat significantly increased LV mass-to-volume ratio compared with vehicle and captopril. Omapatrilat, but not captopril, significantly increased urinary atrial natriuretic peptide excretion, indicating NEP inhibition. Thus vasopeptidase inhibition with omapatrilat was more effective than ACE inhibition with captopril in preventing changes in LV geometry and premature mortality in hamsters with dilated heart failure.
23220742	The selective SYK inhibitor P505-15 (PRT062607) inhibits B cell signaling and function in vitro and in vivo and augments the activity of fludarabine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	B-cell receptor (BCR) associated kinases including spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) contribute to the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies. SYK is persistently phosphorylated in a subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and SYK inhibition results in abrogation of downstream kinase activity and apoptosis. P505-15 (also known as PRT062607) is a novel, highly selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule SYK inhibitor (SYK IC(50) = 1 nM) with anti-SYK activity that is at least 80-fold greater than its affinity for other kinases. We evaluated the preclinical characteristics of P505-15 in models of NHL and CLL. P505-15 successfully inhibited SYK-mediated B-cell receptor signaling and decreased cell viability in NHL and CLL. Oral dosing in mice prevented BCR-mediated splenomegaly and significantly inhibited NHL tumor growth in a xenograft model. In addition, combination treatment of primary CLL cells with P505-15 plus fludarabine produced synergistic enhancement of activity at nanomolar concentrations. Our findings support the ongoing development of P505-15 as a therapeutic agent for B-cell malignancies. A dose finding study in healthy volunteers has been completed.
15705795	Endothelial apoptosis induced by inhibition of integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 involves ceramide metabolic pathways.	Matrix ligation of integrins alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5 is critical for endothelial survival and angiogenesis. We have previously shown that ceramide, a proapoptotic lipid second messenger, increases during endothelial anoikis (detachment-induced apoptosis). We now show that RGDfV, an integrin alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5 cyclic function-blocking peptide, increased ceramide and decreased sphingomyelin in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) plated on vitronectin, suggesting that sphingomyelin hydrolysis contributes to RGDfV-induced ceramide increase. Desipramine and imipramine, inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), suppressed RGDfV-induced ceramide increase. Importantly, desipramine, imipramine, and a third ASMase inhibitor, SR33557, but not inhibitors of neutral sphingomyelinase, suppressed RGDfV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that ASMase was required for integrin-mediated apoptosis. Myriocin, an inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis, had no effect on RGDfV-induced HBMEC apoptosis. Interestingly, ASMase inhibitors also suppressed the RGDfV-induced loss of spreading on vitronectin. RGDfV induced a similar increase in ceramide and apoptosis in HBMECs on poly-l-lysine or vitronectin, although cells detached only from vitronectin, indicating that cell detachment was not required for RGDfV-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest involvement of ASMase and ceramide in endothelial apoptosis induced by inhibition of integrins alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5, and propose a novel molecular mechanism for the antiangiogenic effect of RGDfV.
21058326	Effects of the histamine H1 antagonist chlorcyclizine on rat fetal palate development.	BACKGROUND: The effects of histamine H1 antagonist chlorcyclizine on rat palate development were characterized following in utero exposure. METHODS: To identify the optimum dose for inducing cleft palate, pregnant rats were administered 30, 60, or 90 mg/kg chlorcyclizine on Gestation Days 11 to 14. Fetal palate gene expression was also assessed after 90 mg/kg chlorcyclizine at 8, 15 and 30 hours post-dose on Gestation Day 14 using microarray and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Rats in the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups exhibited adverse clinical signs and body weight loss. Rats in the 90-mg/kg group also demonstrated increases in late resorptions and decreases in fetal weight. Effects in the low-dose group were limited to decreases in body weight gain. Fetal assessment on Gestation Day 21 revealed that findings were limited to the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups, and included cleft palate (80% of litters for both groups), high arched palate, small nose, micrognathia, high domed head, digits shortened/absent and small limb. The fetal incidence of cleft palate was higher at 90 mg/kg, thus this dose was selected to assess palate gene expression. The altered genes associated with chlorcyclizine-induced cleft palate included Wnt5a, Bmp2, Bmp4, Fgf10, Fgfr2, Msx1, and Insig1 but the magnitude of the change was relatively small (1.5- to 2-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Expression of several genes involved in palate, limb and digit development was altered in the fetal palate following in utero exposure to chlorcyclizine. The subtle perturbation and interplay of these genes may have profound effects on the dynamics of fetal palate development.
10685879	Selective inhibition of monoamine neurotransmitter transporters by synthetic local anesthetics.	Synthetic local anesthetics (LAs) have been found to have cocaine-like characteristics with some psychotomimetic action, possibly through monoaminergic neurotransmission. To gain insight into the relation between LA action and monoamine transporters, we investigated the effect of synthetic LAs on neurotransmitter transporters, including monoamine transporters. We used cloned transporter cDNAs and examined transient functional expression in COS cells and stable expression in HeLa cells. Among the LAs tested, procaine and other ester-type LAs inhibited [3H]DA uptake and binding of [3H]2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (CFT), a cocaine analogue, in COS cells expressing rat dopamine transporter (DAT). The inhibition was concentration-dependent. The inhibitory effect on [3H]DA uptake was reversible and not dependent on pH, as observed in HeLa cells stably expressing DAT. Procaine also inhibited uptake of norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) by the norepinephrine transporter (NET) or serotonin transporter (SERT) expressed in COS cells. On the other hand, procaine and other LAs had little or no effect on [3H]GABA and [3H]glutamate uptake in COS cells expressing mouse GABA or rat glutamate/aspartate transporter. IC50 values for [3H]DA uptake inhibition correlated well with those for [3H]CFT binding inhibition, but not with intrinsic anesthetic potency. Kinetic analysis of monoamine uptake inhibition by procaine in COS cells expressing rat DAT, NET or SERT revealed a competitive action similar to that of cocaine. These results demonstrate that certain LAs selectively inhibit monoamine transporters. This might contribute to the cocaine-like psychotomimetic action of certain LAs.
23402371	A membrane vesicle-based assay to enable prediction of human biliary excretion.	Abstract 1. Prediction of biliary excretion is a challenge due to the lack of in vitro assays. Our laboratory previously demonstrated a highly significant correlation between in vitro IC(50) values against mrp2 using rat canalicular liver plasma membrane vesicles and in vivo biliary excretion (Colombo et al., 2012). This study explores the possibility of predicting in vivo biliary excretion in human using membrane vesicles prepared from MDCKII cells transfected with human ABCC2. 2. In vitro MRP2 activity was determined by measuring the ATP-dependent uptake of 5(6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (CDCF) in inside-out membrane vesicles isolated from MDCK-ABCC2 cells. CDCF uptake was time- and concentration-dependent (K(m) of 4.0 ± 1.2 µM and a V(max) of 7.8 ± 0.9 pmol/mg/min) and inhibited by benzbromarone and MK-571 with IC(50) values of 1.2 and 7.6 µM, respectively. 3. A significant linear correlation (r(2 )= 0.790) between the in vitro IC(50) values from the described MRP2 assay and in vivo biliary excretion in humans was observed using 11 well-documented drugs covering low to high biliary excretions. 4. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that inhibition of CDCF uptake in MDCKII-ABCC2 vesicles not only provides a screening assay to assess MRP2 drug-drug interaction potential, but is also predictive of human MRP2-mediated biliary excretion.
14766200	Expression of DDAH1 in chick and rat embryos.	Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1) is an enzyme that metabolizes methylated arginine to citrulline and methylamine, thus working to produce nitric oxide (NO). We isolated a gene encoding chick DDAH1. In situ hybridization analysis revealed characteristic DDAH1 mRNA expression in the embryonic spinal cord, which was especially strong in the ventral horn and dorsal root ganglion (DRG). DDAH1 was also detected in the brain, kidney, digestive tract, and in other tissues. We examined the expression pattern of DDAH1 in developing rats and compared this with the expression pattern in chicks. The expression pattern in the rats was very similar to that in the chicks, but there were some differences between the chicks and rats in the amount of DDAH1 detected in the heart, liver, lung, and DRG. We also investigated neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA expression patterns in rat embryos. The DDAH1 expression patterns were completely different from nNOS expression patterns. Our study suggests that DDAH1 plays an important role in development.
17916059	The use of escitalopram beyond major depression: pharmacological aspects, efficacy and tolerability in anxiety disorders.	Escitalopram, the active (S)-enantiomer of citalopram, has been approved in many countries throughout the world for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. It is more potent and selective than citalopram in inhibiting serotonin re-uptake in the CNS, and less potent than various other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors in relation to other transporter proteins and receptors: in particular, it is six times less potent than citalopram in binding to the histamine H1 and muscarinic receptors. Escitalopram has favourable pharmacokinetics: it is rapidly absorbed, has a bioavailability of 80% and is not affected by food intake. It has little potential for drug interactions: it has low protein binding and, as it is metabolised by three CYP isozymes, any impairment in the activity of one is unlikely to have a significant effect on metabolic clearance. Caution is necessary only when it is coadministered with drugs metabolised by CYP2D6, such as metoprolol, or administered to the elderly or patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of oral escitalopram are proportional at a range of doses including its therapeutic doses. Escitalopram is approved for the treatment of a number of anxiety disorders. It seems to be well tolerated and induces few or no discontinuation symptoms, and may be considered a first-line agent for the pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. Further studies are needed to define its activity in impulse control disorders.
23583931	The ATP required for potentiation of skeletal muscle contraction is released via pannexin hemichannels.	During repetitive stimulation of skeletal muscle, extracellular ATP levels raise, activating purinergic receptors, increasing Ca(2+) influx, and enhancing contractile force, a response called potentiation. We found that ATP appears to be released through pannexin1 hemichannels (Panx1 HCs). Immunocytochemical analyses and function were consistent with pannexin1 localization to T-tubules intercalated with dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors in slow (soleus) and fast (extensor digitorum longus, EDL) muscles. Isolated myofibers took up ethidium (Etd(+)) and released small molecules (as ATP) during electrical stimulation. Consistent with two glucose uptake pathways, induced uptake of 2-NBDG, a fluorescent glucose derivative, was decreased by inhibition of HCs or glucose transporter (GLUT4), and blocked by dual blockade. Adult skeletal muscles apparently do not express connexins, making it unlikely that connexin hemichannels contribute to the uptake and release of small molecules. ATP release, Etd(+) uptake, and potentiation induced by repetitive electrical stimulation were blocked by HC blockers and did not occur in muscles of pannexin1 knockout mice. MRS2179, a P2Y1R blocker, prevented potentiation in EDL, but not soleus muscles, suggesting that in fast muscles ATP activates P2Y1 but not P2X receptors. Phosphorylation on Ser and Thr residues of pannexin1 was increased during potentiation, possibly mediating HC opening. Opening of Panx1 HCs during repetitive activation allows efflux of ATP, influx of glucose and possibly Ca(2+) too, which are required for potentiation of contraction. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Connexin based channels'.
12582227	DRF 2655: a unique molecule that reduces body weight and ameliorates metabolic abnormalities.	OBJECTIVE: Preclinical evaluation of DRF 2655, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PPARgamma agonist, as a body-weight lowering, hypolipidemic and euglycemic agent. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: DRF 2655 was studied in different genetic, normal, and hyperlipidemic animal models. HEK 293 cells were used to conduct the reporter-based transactivation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. To understand the biochemical mechanism of lipid-, body-weight-, and glucose-lowering effects, activities of key beta-oxidation and lipid catabolism enzymes and gluconeogenic enzymes were studied in db/db mice treated with DRF 2655. 3T3L1 cells were used for adipogenesis study, and HepG2 cells were used to study the effect of DRF 2655 on total cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis using [(14)C]acetate and [(3)H]glycerol. RESULTS: DRF 2655 showed concentration-dependent transactivation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. In the 3T3L1 cell-differentiation study, DRF 2655 and rosiglitazone showed 369% and 471% increases, respectively, in triglyceride accumulation. DRF 2655 showed body-weight lowering and euglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in various animal models. db/db mice treated with DRF 2655 showed 5- and 3.6-fold inhibition in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase activity and 651% and 77% increases in the beta-oxidation enzymes carnitine palmitoyltransferase and carnitine acetyltransferase, respectively. HepG2 cells treated with DRF 2655 showed significant reduction in lipid synthesis. DISCUSSION: DRF 2655 showed excellent euglycemic and hypolipidemic activities in different animal models. An exciting finding is its body-weight lowering effect in these models, which might be mediated by the induction of target enzymes involved in hepatic lipid catabolism through PPARalpha activation.
23329465	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: current issues and novel treatment approaches.	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the most common liver disorder in the Western world. It is commonly associated with insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by steatosis with necroinflammation and eventual fibrosis, which can lead to end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its pathogenesis is complex, and involves a state of 'lipotoxicity' in which insulin resistance, with increased free fatty acid release from adipose tissue to the liver, play a key role in the onset of a 'lipotoxic liver disease' and its progression to NASH. The diagnosis of NASH is challenging, as most affected patients are symptom free and the role of routine screening is not clearly established. A complete medical history is important to rule out other causes of fatty liver disease (alcohol abuse, medications, other). Plasma aminotransferase levels and liver ultrasound are helpful in the diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH, but a liver biopsy is often required for a definitive diagnosis. However, there is an active search for plasma biomarkers and imaging techniques that may non-invasively aid in the diagnosis. The treatment of NASH requires a multifaceted approach. The goal is to reverse obesity-associated lipotoxicity and insulin resistance via lifestyle intervention. Although there is no pharmacological agent approved for the treatment of NAFLD, vitamin E (in patients without T2DM) and the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone (in patients with and without T2DM) have shown the most consistent results in randomized controlled trials. This review concentrates on our current understanding of the disease, with a focus on the existing therapeutic approaches and potential future pharmacological developments for NAFLD and NASH.
1407010	"5-HT1R" or 5-HT1D sites? Evidence for 5-HT1D binding sites in rabbit brain.	Radioligand binding studies were performed in membranes of rabbit whole brain and striatum using the novel iodinated radioligand for 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D sites, Serotonin-5-O-Carboxymethyl-Glycyl[125I]Tyrosinamide ([125I]GTI). [125I]GTI labelled a finite number of high affinity sites in rabbit brain membranes, Bmax = 191 +/- 47 fmol/mg protein, pKD (-log mol/l) = 8.50 +/- 0.13, n = 5. The pharmacological profile of [125I]GTI binding was fully comparable to that reported previously in human and other brain preparations known to possess 5-HT1D sites (using either [3H]5-HT or [125I]GTI) and displayed a characteristic rank order of affinity: 5-carboxamido-tryptamine greater than 5-HT = dihydroergotamine greater than or equal to ergotamine greater than or equal to sumatriptan greater than or equal to CGS 12066 greater than or equal to metergoline greater than yohimbine greater than or equal to methysergide greater than ICYP greater than 8-OH-DPAT greater than or equal to CP 93129 greater than (-)pindolol greater than ketanserin greater than isamoltane greater than mesulergine greater than corynanthine greater than buspirone greater than MDL 72222. Autoradiographic studies were performed on rabbit brain slices using [3H]5-HT in the presence of 100 nmol/l 8-OH-DPAT and mesulergine (in order to mask 5-HT1A and 5-HT1C binding sites) and [125I]CYP (iodocyanopindolol) in the presence of 3 mumol/l isoprenaline and 100 nmol/l 8-OH-DPAT (in order to mask beta adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A binding sites). There was no detectable specific binding of [125I]CYP through the brain, thus excluding the presence of 5-HT1B sites in rabbit brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
15931605	Use of nitisinone in patients with alkaptonuria.	Alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HGD gene and deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase, is characterized by ochronosis, arthritis, and daily excretion of gram quantities of homogentisic acid (HGA). Nitisinone, an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, can drastically reduce urinary excretion of HGA in individuals with alkaptonuria. We investigated the safety and the HGA-depleting efficacy of nitisinone in an open-label, single-center study of 9 alkaptonuria patients (5 women, 4 men; 35-69 years of age) over the course of 3 to 4 months. Each patient received nitisinone in incremental doses, 0.35 mg bid followed by 1.05 mg bid, and remained on this dosage and a regular diet for 3 months. Nitisinone reduced urinary HGA levels from an average of 4.0 +/- 1.8 (SD) g/day to 0.2 +/- 0.2 g/day ( P < .001). The average plasma tyrosine concentration, initially 68 +/- 18 mmicro mol/L, rose to 760 +/- 181 micro mol/L ( P < .001). During the final week of the study, 5 patients adhered to a protein-restricted diet (40 g/day), and their mean plasma tyrosine level fell from 755 +/- 167 to 603 +/- 114 mu mol/L. Six of the 7 patients who received nitisinone for more than 1 week reported decreased pain in their affected joints. Weekly ophthalmologic examinations showed no signs of corneal toxicity. Adverse events included the passing of kidney stones, the recognition of symptoms related to aortic stenosis, and elevation of liver transaminase levels. We conclude that low-dose nitisinone effectively reduced urinary HGA levels in patients with alkaptonuria. Future long-term clinical trials are planned to determine the benefits of nitisinone in preventing joint deterioration and providing pain relief, and its long-term side effects.
11455568	Effects of 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) on rat growth zone chondrocytes are mediated via cyclooxygenase-1 and phospholipase A(2).	1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) mediates its effects on growth zone chondrocytes via rapid membrane-associated events as well as through traditional nuclear receptor mechanisms. The membrane-associated signaling pathways include rapid production of diacylglycerol and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), as well as activation of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), increased production of arachidonic acid, and increased production of prostaglandins. This study examined the roles of PLA(2) and cyclooxygenase (Cox) in the mechanism of action of 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in these cells to determine whether one or both enzymes catalyze the rate limiting step and whether constitutive or inducible Cox is involved. Cultures were incubated with 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) for 9 min to measure PKC or for 24 h to measure physiological responses ([(3)H]-thymidine incorporation, alkaline phosphatase specific activity, [(35)S]-sulfate incorporation). Based on RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, growth zone chondrocytes expressed mRNAs for both Cox-1 and Cox-2 and neither Cox was modulated by 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3). To examine the role of Cox, the cultures were also treated with resveratrol (a specific inhibitor of Cox-1), NS-398 (a specific inhibitor of Cox-2), or indomethacin (a general Cox inhibitor). The results showed that Cox-1 inhibition reduced the 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-dependent effects on proliferation, differentiation, and matrix production, whereas inhibition of Cox-2 only had an effect on proliferation. The effects of Cox inhibition were not rate limiting, based on experiments in which PLA(2) was activated with melittin or inhibited with quinacrine. However, at least part of the action of 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) was regulated by metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. This supports the hypothesis that 1alpha,25-(OH)(2)D(3) exerts its effects via more than one signaling pathway and that these pathways are interrelated via the modulation of PLA(2) as a rate-limiting step. PKC regulation may occur at multiple stages in the signal transduction cascade. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 36: 32-45, 2001.
3089818	Intestinal permeability and lactose hydrolysis in human rotaviral gastroenteritis assessed simultaneously by non-invasive differential sugar permeation.	Changes in intestinal permeability and lactose hydrolysis have been investigated in three adults and fifteen infants with acute rotaviral gastroenteritis by differential sugar absorption. The method involves chromatographic measurement of urinary lactose, lactulose and L-rhamnose excretion following combined ingestion in an iso-osmolar test solution. All patients had abnormal intestinal permeability indicated by raised urine lactulose/L-rhamnose excretion, ratio of percentages recovered in 5 h, of 0.462 (0.100-1.227) mean and range, compared with 0.027 (0.008-0.052) for healthy controls (P less than 0.001). Ten patients also had urinary lactose/lactulose excretion ratios raised above the normal range (0.014-0.41, mean 0.258) during their acute illness, indicating impaired intestinal lactose hydrolysis. Both indices had become normal 4 weeks after the acute illness, serial investigation of five patients showing that improvement was complete much earlier. Except for the short duration these changes are similar to those associated with villous atrophy in coeliac disease. The test procedure was verified with respect to intestinal lactose hydrolysis by demonstrating a linear relationship between lactose/lactulose excretion and log jejunal mucosal lactase activity by in vitro assay (R2 = 0.95) in a further group of subjects. Differential lactose/lactulose/L-rhamnose absorption provides a non-invasive and sensitive index of small intestinal integrity of value for the interpretation of prolonged or otherwise complicated enteritis and the distinction of primary secondary intestinal lactase deficiency.
12183670	Bupropion inhibits nicotine-evoked [(3)H]overflow from rat striatal slices preloaded with [(3)H]dopamine and from rat hippocampal slices preloaded with [(3)H]norepinephrine.	Bupropion, an efficacious antidepressant and smoking cessation agent, inhibits dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (DAT and NET, respectively). Recently, bupropion has been reported to noncompetitively inhibit alpha3beta2, alpha3beta4, and alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in Xenopus oocytes or established cell lines. The present study evaluated bupropion-induced inhibition of native alpha3beta2* and alpha3beta4* nAChRs using functional neurotransmitter release assays, nicotine-evoked [(3)H]overflow from superfused rat striatal slices preloaded with [(3)H]dopamine ([(3)H]DA), and nicotine-evoked [(3)H]overflow from hippocampal slices preloaded with [(3)H]norepinephrine ([(3)H]NE). The mechanism of inhibition was evaluated using Schild analysis. To eliminate the interaction of bupropion with DAT or NET, nomifensine or desipramine, respectively, was included in the superfusion buffer. A high bupropion concentration (100 microM) elicited intrinsic activity in the [(3)H]DA release assay. However, none of the concentrations (1 nM-100 microM) examined evoked [(3)H]NE overflow and, thus, were without intrinsic activity in this assay. Moreover, bupropion inhibited both nicotine-evoked [(3)H]DA overflow (IC(50) = 1.27 microM) and nicotine-evoked [(3)H]NE overflow (IC(50) = 323 nM) at bupropion concentrations well below those eliciting intrinsic activity. Results from Schild analyses suggest that bupropion competitively inhibits nicotine-evoked [(3)H]DA overflow, whereas evidence for receptor reserve was obtained upon assessment of bupropion inhibition of nicotine-evoked [(3)H]NE overflow. Thus, bupropion acts as an antagonist at alpha3beta2* and alpha3beta4* nAChRs in rat striatum and hippocampus, respectively, across the same concentration range that inhibits DAT and NET function. The combination of nAChR and transporter inhibition produced by bupropion may contribute to its clinical efficacy as a smoking cessation agent.
2087492	Barrel rotation in rats induced by SMS 201-995: suppression by ceruletide.	Intracerebroventricular administration of SMS 201-995 (5 micrograms/rat), a somatostatin analogue, induced barrel rotation in rats. Pretreatment with ceruletide (40 micrograms/100 g b. wt., IP) 3 days or 7 days prior to the injection of SMS 201-995 significantly inhibited the response rate of barrel rotation induced by SMS 201-995, but not that induced by arginine-vasopressin (1 microgram/rat, ICV). The suppressive effect of ceruletide on barrel rotation could be partially countered by MK-329, a selective peripheral CCK (CCK-A) receptor antagonist. Desulfated cerulein did not affect the barrel rotation induced by SMS 201-995. These findings suggest that ceruletide specifically suppresses the barrel rotation evoked by SMS 201-995 in a long-lasting manner possibly acting through CCK-A receptor.
15001403	A comparison of phenytoin-loading techniques in the emergency department.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectivenesses of three phenytoin-loading techniques. METHODS: Patients with subtherapeutic phenytoin concentrations who presented within 48 hours of a seizure were randomized to receive either 20 mg/kg of oral phenytoin (PO), divided in maximum doses of 400 mg every two hours, 18 mg/kg of intravenous phenytoin (IVP) at an initial infusion rate of 50 mg/min, or 18 mg/kg (phenytoin equivalents) of intravenous fosphenytoin (IVF) at an initial infusion rate of 150 mg/min. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were enrolled: 16 in the PO group, 14 in the IVP group, and 15 in the IVF group. The times required to reach therapeutic drug concentrations were (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) 5.62 +/- 0.28 hours, 0.24 +/- 0.3 hours, and 0.21 +/- 0.28 hours, respectively. A total of 17, 27, and 32 adverse drug events were observed in the PO, IVP, and IVF groups, respectively, with significantly fewer events in the PO group (p = 0.02, p = 0.01). No significant difference was found between the numbers of necessary adjustments to the infusions in the two IV groups. The average time to safe emergency department discharge was significantly shorter for the IV groups compared with the PO group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral loading has fewer adverse drug events than either IV loading method, but its use may be limited when therapeutic concentrations are required quickly. Although IVF loading is faster, from an adverse-drug event perspective, no advantage of IVF over IVP was apparent.
10420171	Discovery of novel peptidic dopamine transporter ligands by screening a positional scanning combinatorial hexapeptide library.	The acute reinforcing effects of cocaine are thought by some to result from cocaine binding to the dopamine (DA) transporter, which inhibits DA uptake and increases synaptic DA levels in the mesolimbic system. Other data suggest that neurotransmitters other than DA contribute to cocaine reinforcement and addiction. These considerations illustrate the need to have additional research tools with which to test the "DA hypothesis." One strategy is to identify drugs which bind to the DA transporter (DAT ligands) but which do not inhibit DA uptake as effectively as cocaine. The purpose of the present study was to identify members of a novel structural class of DAT ligands and to characterize their interactions at the DA transporter. A positional scanning hexapeptide D-amino acid library was screened for inhibition of [(125)I]RTI-55 binding to rat caudate DA transporters. Based on the results, 12 peptides were synthesized. All 12 peptides inhibited [(125)I]RTI-55 binding to DA transporters with IC(50) values, which ranged from 1.8 microM to 12 microM. The two most potent peptides (TPI-669-1 and TPI-669-4) were prepared in larger quantities and were characterized further for activity at the DAT and 5-HT transporter. Both peptides inhibited DA and 5-HT uptake and transporter binding with IC(50)/K(i) values in the low micromolar range. In vivo microdialysis studies demonstrated that both peptides increase extracellular DA and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens of rats. These data demonstrate that peptides can function as inhibitors of biogenic amine transport. Future work will focus on developing more potent and selective peptides. Published 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
1329582	Effects of nedocromil sodium and WEB 2086 on chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil migration through cellular and noncellular barriers.	Nedocromil sodium (Tilade) is an effective therapeutic agent against asthma and has been shown to exhibit antiinflammatory activity in vitro; however, its mode of action is yet to be described fully. Using an in vitro assay designed to mimic the extravasation of neutrophils from the peripheral circulation through cellular barriers to sites of inflammation, the effect of nedocromil sodium on chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophil migration was examined. We also examined the effects of WEB 2086, a platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, in parallel. Neutrophils and the cellular barrier were pretreated and/or co-incubated with nedocromil or WEB 2086 and the effects on neutrophil chemotaxis measured. In all treatments, nedocromil did not significantly affect chemotaxis through cellular or noncellular barriers to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), or PAF. In contrast, WEB 2086 inhibited PAF-induced neutrophil migration through both naked filters and endothelial and epithelial monolayers cultured on these filters. We conclude that while nedocromil has been shown to have inhibitory effects on neutrophils and is an effective therapeutic agent for asthma and inflammatory conditions, its activity is not primarily mediated by inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. Platelet-activating factor antagonists may partially be effective in asthma through inhibitory effects on neutrophil chemotaxis.
23065141	The toxicity of the N-hydroxy and 6-hydroxy metabolites of 3,4-dichloropropionanilide does not depend on calcium release-activated calcium channel inhibition.	Each year ~1 billion kg of herbicides are used worldwide to control the unwanted growth of plants. In the United States, over a quarter of a billion kg of herbicides are used, representing 28% of worldwide use. (Kiely, T., Donaldson, D., and Grube, A. [2004]. Pesticide Industry Sales and Usage. 2000 and 2001 Market Estimates. Available at: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/pestsales/01pestsales/market_estimates2001.pdf. Accessed October 25, 2012.) Propanil (3,4-dichloropropionanilide [DCPA]) is a commonly used herbicide in the United States, with 2-4 million kg applied annually to 2 million acres of crop land. The immunomodulatory effects of DCPA have been well documented, but limited data are available on the effects of its metabolites. (Salazar, K. D., Ustyugova, I. V., Brundage, K. M., Barnett, J. B., and Schafer, R. [2008]. A review of the immunotoxicity of the pesticide 3,4-dichloropropionanalide. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B Crit. Rev. 11, 630-645.) In mammals, hepatic enzymes metabolize DCPA, resulting in the production of 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA). Further biotransformation of DCA leads to the production of 6-hydroxy-3,4-dichloroaniline (6OH-DCA) and N-hydroxy-3,4-dichloroaniline (NOH-DCA). We report, for the first time, the immunotoxic effects of DCPA metabolites on T-cell function. Human Jurkat T cells were exposed to varying concentrations of DCPA or its metabolites and assayed for effects on T-cell function. In addition, fluorine analogs of DCPA and DCA were investigated to determine the relative role of chlorine substituents on T-cell immunotoxicity. Here we report that exposure of Jurkat T cells to DCPA and DCA alters IL-2 secretion, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity, and calcium influx. However, exposure to 6OH-DCA and NOH-DCA reduces IL-2 secretion and NFAT activity but has no effect on calcium flux. When both chlorines in DCPA and DCA were substituted with fluorines all effects were abrogated. Our data indicate that metabolites of DCPA have differential effects on T-cell function and the presence of chlorines plays an important role in eliciting these effects.
10908292	Modulation of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels by the novel anticonvulsant retigabine.	Retigabine is a novel anticonvulsant with an unknown mechanism of action. It has recently been reported that retigabine modulates a potassium channel current in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells (), however, to date the molecular correlate of this current has not been identified. In the present study we have examined the effects of retigabine on recombinant human KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 potassium channels, expressed either alone or in combination in Xenopus oocytes. Application of 10 microM retigabine to oocytes expressing the KCNQ2/3 heteromeric channel shifted both the activation threshold and voltage for half-activation by approximately 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction, leading to an increase in current amplitude at test potentials between -80 mV and +20 mV. Retigabine also had a marked effect on KCNQ current kinetics, increasing the rate of channel activation but slowing deactivation at a given test potential. Similar effects of retigabine were observed in oocytes expressing KCNQ2 alone, suggesting that KCNQ2 may be the molecular target of retigabine. Membrane potential recordings in oocytes expressing the KCNQ2/3 heteromeric channel showed that application of retigabine leads to a concentration-dependent hyperpolarization of the oocyte, from a resting potential of -63 mV under control conditions to -85 mV in the presence of 100 microM retigabine (IC(50) = 5.2 microM). In control experiments retigabine had no effect on either resting membrane potential or endogenous oocyte membrane currents. In conclusion, we have shown that retigabine acts as a KCNQ potassium channel opener. Because the heteromeric KCNQ2/3 channel has recently been reported to underlie the M-current, it is likely that M-current modulation can explain the anticonvulsant actions of retigabine in animal models of epilepsy.
23478260	Age-Related Macular Degeneration-Associated Silent Polymorphisms in HtrA1 Impair Its Ability To Antagonize Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1.	Synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a transcript's coding region produce no change in the amino acid sequence of the protein product and are therefore intuitively assumed to have a neutral effect on protein function. We report that two common variants of high-temperature requirement A1 (HTRA1) that increase the inherited risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NvAMD) harbor synonymous SNPs within exon 1 of HTRA1 that convert common codons for Ala34 and Gly36 to less frequently used codons. The frequent-to-rare codon conversion reduced the mRNA translation rate and appeared to compromise HtrA1's conformation and function. The protein product generated from the SNP-containing cDNA displayed enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis and a reduced affinity for an anti-HtrA1 antibody. The NvAMD-associated synonymous polymorphisms lie within HtrA1's putative insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) binding domain. They reduced HtrA1's abilities to associate with IGF-1 and to ameliorate IGF-1-stimulated signaling events and cellular responses. These observations highlight the relevance of synonymous codon usage to protein function and implicate homeostatic protein quality control mechanisms that may go awry in NvAMD.
23479389	[6]-gingerol: a novel AT₁ antagonist for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.	Considering the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in public health and the limited validated therapeutic options, this study aimed to find novel compounds targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, accepted as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease. A small library consisting of 89 compounds from 39 Chinese herbs was profiled using a cell-based calcium mobilization assay which was developed and characterized for high-throughput screening. [6]-Gingerol derived from Zingiber officinale Roscoe (ginger) was identified as a novel angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, with an IC50 value of 8.173 µM. The hit was further tested by a specificity assay indicating that it had no antagonistic effects on other evaluated GPCRs, such as endothelin receptors. The major ingredient of ginger, [6]-gingerol, could inhibit angiotensin II type 1 receptor activation, which partially clarified the mechanism of ginger regulating blood pressure and strengthening heart in the cardiovascular system.
22812659	Androgen insensitivity syndrome.	Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a disorder caused by a mutation of the gene encoding the androgen receptor (AR; Xq11-q12). The prevalence of AIS has been estimated to be one case in every 20,000 to 64,000 newborn males for the complete syndrome (CAIS), and the prevalence is unknown for the partial syndrome (PAIS). The symptoms range from phenotypically normal males with impaired spermatogenesis to phenotypically normal women with primary amenorrhea. Various forms of ambiguous genitalia have been observed at birth. The diagnosis is confirmed by determining the exact mutation in the AR gene. PAIS individuals require precise diagnosis as early as possible so that the sex can be assigned, treatment can be recommended, and they can receive proper genetic counseling. After birth, differential diagnosis should be performed using other forms of abnormal sexual differentiation of primary amenorrhea. The treatment of AIS is based on reinforcement sexual identity, gonadectomy planning, and hormone replacement therapy. The prognosis for CAIS is good if the testicular tissue is removed at the appropriate time. For PAIS, the prognosis depends on the ambiguity of the genitalia and physical and psychosocial adjustment to the assigned sex.
23028137	Portal vein glucose entry triggers a coordinated cellular response that potentiates hepatic glucose uptake and storage in normal but not high-fat/high-fructose-fed dogs.	The cellular events mediating the pleiotropic actions of portal vein glucose (PoG) delivery on hepatic glucose disposition have not been clearly defined. Likewise, the molecular defects associated with postprandial hyperglycemia and impaired hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) following consumption of a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFFD) are unknown. Our goal was to identify hepatocellular changes elicited by hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and PoG signaling in normal chow-fed (CTR) and HFFD-fed dogs. In CTR dogs, we demonstrated that PoG infusion in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia triggered an increase in the activity of hepatic glucokinase (GK) and glycogen synthase (GS), which occurred in association with further augmentation in HGU and glycogen synthesis (GSYN) in vivo. In contrast, 4 weeks of HFFD feeding markedly reduced GK protein content and impaired the activation of GS in association with diminished HGU and GSYN in vivo. Furthermore, the enzymatic changes associated with PoG sensing in chow-fed animals were abolished in HFFD-fed animals, consistent with loss of the stimulatory effects of PoG delivery. These data reveal new insight into the molecular physiology of the portal glucose signaling mechanism under normal conditions and to the pathophysiology of aberrant postprandial hepatic glucose disposition evident under a diet-induced glucose-intolerant condition.
23574807	Synthesis, Antidepressant Evaluation and Docking Studies of Long-Chain Alkylnitroquipazines as Serotonin Transporter Inhibitors.	Twelve alkyl analogues (1-12) of the high-affinity serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitor 6-nitroquipazine (6-NQ) were synthesized and studied using in vitro radioligand competition binding assays to determine their binding affinity (Ki ). The putative antidepressant activity of five of the binders with the highest SERT binding affinities was studied by the forced swim and locomotor activity mouse tests. The three-dimensional (3D) structures of 8 and 9 were determined using NOE NMR technique. Flexible docking of the compounds was undertaken to illustrate the binding of the compounds in the SERT model. Our results showed that several of the 6-NQ analogues are high-affinity SERT inhibitors and indicated that the octyl (8), decyl (10) and dodecyl (12) 6-NQ analogues exhibit moderate antidepressant activity.
23348407	Dietary relevant mixtures of phytoestrogens inhibit adipocyte differentiation in vitro.	Phytoestrogens (PEs) are naturally occurring plant components, with the ability to induce biological responses in vertebrates by mimicking or modulating the action of endogenous hormones. Single isoflavones have been shown to affect adipocyte differentiation, but knowledge on the effect of dietary relevant mixtures of PEs, including for instance lignans, is lacking. In the current study dietary relevant mixtures of isoflavones and their metabolites, lignans and their metabolites, coumestrol, and a mixture containing all of them, were examined for effects on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as well as tested for their PPARγ activating abilities. The results showed that mixtures of isoflavonoid parent compounds and metabolites, respectively, a mixture of lignan metabolites, as well as coumestrol concentration-dependently inhibited adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, a mixture of isoflavonoid parent compounds, and a mixture of isoflavonoid metabolites were found to have PPARγ activating abilities. These results suggest that PEs can affect pathways known to play a role in obesity development, and indicate that the inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation does not appear to be strictly associated with PPARγ activation/inhibition. The current study support the hypothesis that compounds with endocrine activity can affect pathways playing a role in the development obesity and obesity related diseases.
23330542	PXR antagonists and implication in drug metabolism.	Adopted orphan nuclear receptor (NR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), plays a central role in the regulation of xeno- and endobiotic metabolism. Since the discovery of the functional role of PXR in 1998, there is evolving evidence for the role of PXR agonists in abrogating metabolic pathophysiology (e.g., cholestasis, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation). However, more recently, it is clear that PXR is also an important mediator of adverse xeno- (e.g., enhances acetaminophen toxicity) and endobiotic (e.g., hepatic steatosis) metabolic phenotypes. Moreover, in cancer therapeutics, PXR activation can induce drug resistance, and there is growing evidence for tissue-specific enhancement of the malignant phenotype. Thus, in these instances, there may be a role for PXR antagonists. However, as opposed to the discovery efforts for PXR agonists, there are only a few antagonists described. The mode of action of these antagonists (e.g., sulforaphane) remains less clear. Our laboratory efforts have focused on this question. Since the original discovery of azoles analogs as PXR antagonists, we have preliminarily defined an important PXR antagonist pharmacophore and developed less-toxic PXR antagonists. In this review, we describe our published and unpublished findings on recent structure-function studies involving the azole chemical scaffold. Further work in the future is needed to fully define potent, more-selective PXR antagonists that may be useful in clinical application.
19503773	Tolcapone: review of its pharmacology and use as adjunctive therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease.	Levodopa has been the gold standard therapy for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease for more than three decades. Although it remains the most effective treatment, its long-term use is associated with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias that can be disabling for patients and difficult for physicians to manage medically. In the last 10 years, the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone has been studied for its efficacy as an adjunctive treatment to levodopa plus a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor. Adjunctive therapy with tolcapone can significantly reduce the dose of levodopa required. Moreover, treatment with tolcapone significantly reduces wearing off and on-off periods in fluctuating patients and improves 'on' time in patients with stable disease. Tolcapone has assumed a new place in the arsenal of medications for Parkinson's disease. This paper reviews the pharmacology, safety and efficacy of tolcapone in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. After some initial concerns about its safety, tolcapone has been shown to be safe if used and monitored according to guidelines regarding liver function. Tolcapone produces expected dopaminergic side effects, including headache, nausea, insomnia, as well as diarrhea; however, these side effects are generally mild and as a rule do not result in discontinuation of therapy.
18423812	Triple pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in nondiabetic CKD: an open-label crossover randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Agents inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system have an important role in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease. We evaluated the hypothesis that the addition of an aldosterone receptor antagonist to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 (AT-1) receptor blocker (ARB) (triple RAAS blockade) may provide an additional benefit compared with an ACE inhibitor and ARB (double RAAS blockade). DESIGN: Randomized open controlled crossover study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 18 whites (7 women, 11 men) from the Outpatient Department of Nephrology with chronic nondiabetic proteinuric kidney diseases, mean age 42.4 +/- 1.9 years (SEM). INTERVENTIONS: In the 8-week run-in period, all participants received the ACE inhibitor cilazapril (5 mg), the ARB telmisartan (80 mg), and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) as double RAAS blockade to achieve the target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Participants were then randomly assigned to 2 treatment sequences, either the addition of spironolactone (25 mg) (triple RAAS blockade) through 8 weeks followed by double RAAS blockade through 8 weeks (sequence 1) or double RAAS blockade followed by triple RAAS blockade (sequence 2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 24-hour urine protein excretion (primary end point) and markers of tubular injury and fibrosis (secondary end points). Analysis was performed using analysis of variance for repeated measurements. RESULTS: At baseline, mean serum creatinine level was 1.16 +/- 0.09 mg/dL (103 +/- 8 micromol/L), estimated glomerular filtration rate was 107.8 mL/min (95% confidence interval, 93 to 140.9 [1.8 mL/s; 95% confidence interval, 1.55 to 2.35; Cockcroft-Gault formula), and 24-hour mean proteinuria was 0.97 +/- 0.18 g. Mean urine protein excretion was 0.7 g/24 h (95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.92) less after triple RAAS blockade than after double RAAS blockade (P = 0.01), without change in blood pressure. Urine excretion of N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (P = 0.02) and amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (P = 0.05) also significantly decreased. Potassium levels increased significantly after triple therapy (P = 0.02). However, no patient was withdrawn because of adverse effects. LIMITATIONS: Absence of blinding, small sample size, short treatment period, absence of histological assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of an aldosterone receptor antagonist in addition to double RAAS blockade with an ACE inhibitor and ARB may slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. Additional studies are necessary to confirm this result.
15336276	Probing for a hydrophobic a binding register in prostate-specific membrane antigen with phenylalkylphosphonamidates.	To explore for the existence of an auxiliary hydrophobic binding register remote from the active site of PSMA a series of phenylalkylphosphonamidate derivatives of glutamic acid were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory potencies against PSMA. Both the phenyl- and benzylphosphonamidates (1a and 1b) exhibited only modest inhibitory potency against. The phenethyl analog 1c was intermediate in inhibitory potency while inhibitors possessing a longer alkyl tether from the phenyl ring, resulted in markedly improved K(i) values. The greatest inhibitory potency was obtained for the inhibitors in which the phenyl ring was extended furthest from the central phosphorus (1f, n=5 and 1g, n=6). The slightly serrated pattern that emerged as the alkyl tether increased from three to six methylene units suggests that inhibitory potency is not simply correlated to increased hydrophobicity imparted by the phenylalkyl chain, but rather that one or more hydrophobic binding registers may exist remote from the substrate recognition architecture in the active site of PSMA.
17869551	Endothelial nitric oxide production is tightly coupled to the citrulline-NO cycle.	Nitric oxide (NO) is an important vasorelaxant produced along with L-citrulline from L-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Previous studies suggested that the recycling of L-citrulline to L-arginine is essential for NO production in endothelial cells. However, there is no direct evidence demonstrating the degree to which the recycling of L-citrulline to L-arginine is coupled to NO production. We hypothesized that the amount of NO formed would be significantly higher than the amount of L-citrulline formed due to the efficiency of L-citrulline recycling via the citrulline-NO cycle. To test this hypothesis, endothelial cells were incubated with [14C]-L-arginine and stimulated by various agents to produce NO. The extent of NO and [14C]-L-citrulline formation were simultaneously determined. NO production exceeded apparent L-citrulline formation of the order of 8 to 1, under both basal and stimulated conditions. As further support, alpha-methyl-DL-aspartate, an inhibitor of argininosuccinate synthase (AS), a component of the citrulline-NO cycle, inhibited NO production in a dose-dependent manner. The results of this study provide evidence for the essential and efficient coupling of L-citrulline recycling, via the citrulline-NO cycle, to endothelial NO production.
3098406	Prevention of dacarbazine damage of human neoplastic cell DNA by aphidicolin.	Treatment of human neoplastic cells with dacarbazine both inhibits DNA synthesis and induces damage in the DNA. Lysis of cells in dilute alkali and subsequent electrophoretic analysis of the isolated DNA show that the DNA of treated cells includes a high molecular weight component and a population of 2-10-kilobase single-stranded DNA fragments while untreated cells contain only high molecular weight DNA. When DNA is pulse-labeled at the beginning of the dacarbazine treatment high amounts of small DNA fragments are seen but no labeled high molecular weight DNA. Moreover the DNA fragments are not formed in cells which are treated with aphidicolin before the addition of dacarbazine. Aphidicolin is a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, the enzyme responsible for the replicative synthesis of DNA. We conclude that dacarbazine damages DNA only in cells which are synthesizing new DNA.
23230133	The bovine ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 Tyr581Ser single-nucleotide polymorphism increases milk secretion of the fluoroquinolone danofloxacin.	The bovine adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein) polymorphism Tyr581Ser (Y581S) has recently been shown to increase in vitro transepithelial transport of antibiotics. Since this transporter has been extensively related to the active secretion of drugs into milk, the potential in vivo effect of this polymorphism on secretion of xenobiotics in livestock could have striking consequences for milk production, the dairy industry, and public health. Our purpose was to study the in vivo effect of this polymorphism on the secretion of danofloxacin, a widely used veterinary antibiotic, into milk. Danofloxacin (1.25 mg/kg) was administered to six Y/Y 581 homozygous and six Y/S 581 heterozygous lactating cows, and plasma and milk samples were collected and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. No differences were found in the pharmacokinetic parameters of danofloxacin in plasma between the two groups of animals. In contrast, Y/S heterozygous cows showed a 2-fold increase in danofloxacin levels in milk. In addition, the pharmacokinetic elimination parameters, mean residence time and elimination half-life, were significantly lower in the milk of the animals carrying the Y/S polymorphism. These in vivo results are in agreement with our previously published in vitro data, which showed a greater capacity of the S581 variant in accumulation assays, and demonstrate, for the first time, an important effect of the Y581S single-nucleotide polymorphism on antibiotic secretion into cow milk. These findings could be extended to other ABCG2 substrates, and may be relevant for the treatment of mastitis and for the design of accurate and novel strategies to handle milk residues.
23224291	Proteomic and metabolomic responses to connexin43 silencing in primary hepatocyte cultures.	Freshly established cultures of primary hepatocytes progressively adopt a foetal-like phenotype and display increased production of connexin43. The latter is a multifaceted cellular entity with variable subcellular locations, including the mitochondrial compartment. Cx43 forms hemichannels and gap junctions that are involved in a plethora of physiological and pathological processes, such as apoptosis. The present study was conducted with the goal of shedding more light onto the role of connexin43 in primary hepatocyte cultures. Connexin43 expression was suppressed by means of RNA interference technology, and the overall outcome of this treatment on the hepatocellular proteome and metabolome was investigated using tandem mass tag-based differential protein profiling and (1)H NMR spectroscopy, respectively. Global protein profiling revealed a number of targets of the connexin43 knock-down procedure, including mitochondrial proteins (heat shock protein 60, glucose-regulated protein 75, thiosulphate sulphurtransferase and adenosine triphosphate synthase) and detoxifying enzymes (glutathione S-transferase μ 2 and cytochrome P450 2C70). At the metabolomic level, connexin43 silencing caused no overt changes, though there was some evidence for a subtle increase in intracellular glycine quantities. Collectively, these data could further substantiate the established existence of a mitochondrial connexin pool and could be reconciled with the previously reported involvement of connexin43 signalling in spontaneously occurring apoptosis in primary hepatocyte cultures.
15942128	Butorphanol: effects of a prototypical agonist-antagonist analgesic on kappa-opioid receptors.	The opioid analgesic, butorphanol (17-cyclobutylmethyl-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan) tartrate is a prototypical agonist-antagonist opioid analgesic agent whose potential for abuse has been the cause of litigation in the United States. With a published affinity for opioid receptors in vitro of 1:4:25 (mu:delta:kappa), the relative contribution of actions at each of these receptors to the in vivo actions of the drug are an issue of active investigation. A body of evidence has been developed which indicates that a substantial selective action of butorphanol on the kappa-opioid receptor mediates the development of tolerance to butorphanol and cross-tolerance to other opioid agonists; to the production of dependence upon butorphanol, particularly in the rodent; and to compensatory alterations in brain opioid receptor-effector systems. This perspective will identify the current state of understanding of the effects produced by butorphanol on brain opioid receptors, particularly on the kappa-opioid receptor subtype, and on the expression of phosphotyrosyl proteins following chronic treatment with butorphanol.
20800906	Low dose combination steroids control autoimmune mouse hearing loss.	The severe side effects of glucocorticoids prevent long term management of hearing loss. Alternative steroid treatments that minimize or eliminate these effects would significantly benefit therapeutic control of hearing disorders. A steroid treatment study of autoimmune mouse hearing loss was conducted to determine the efficacy of combining aldosterone and prednisolone at low doses. An assessment also was made of low dose fludrocortisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid that also has a slight glucocorticoid effect. MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) mice were tested for baseline ABR thresholds at 3 months of age and then treated with aldosterone (3.0 mug/kg) or prednisolone (1.0 mg/kg) to determine the lowest effective dose of each. Other mice were given the two steroids in combination at doses of Pred 0.5 mg+Aldo 1.5 mug; Pred 1.0 mg+Aldo 3.0 mug; or Pred 1.5 mg+Aldo 5.0 mug. Mice were retested with ABR at 1 and 2 months to determine the efficacy of the different steroid treatments in controlling hearing loss. Another series of mice were given the synthetic mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone at low (2.8 mug/kg) or high (10 mug/kg) doses and retested at monthly intervals for 3 months. Autoimmune mouse hearing loss developed in untreated controls. This threshold elevation was not prevented by prednisolone at 1 mg/kg or by aldosterone at 3 mug/kg when each was given alone. However, the two steroids combined at these doses effectively controlled hearing loss. The fludrocortisone treatments also were effective at low doses in preventing or reversing the autoimmune mouse hearing loss. This efficacy of combined steroids at low doses suggests the potential for reducing the side effects of glucocorticoids in the therapeutic control of hearing disorders.
10340919	Comparison of inhibitory effects of meloxicam and diclofenac on human thromboxane biosynthesis after single doses and at steady state.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the extent of human cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition by meloxicam, which has been reported to preferentially inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The effects of meloxicam were compared with those of diclofenac, a nonselective COX inhibitor. METHODS: COX-1 inhibition was determined by measuring thromboxane B2 (TXB2)-generation from clotting whole blood ex vivo after single oral doses of 7.5 and 15 mg meloxicam and 75 mg diclofenac and at steady state (15 mg meloxicam daily and 150 mg diclofenac daily). The effect was expressed as percentage inhibition of serum TXB2 generation and was directly related to the serum drug concentration with use of a standard sigmoidal E(max) model. RESULTS: In terms of inhibition of TXB2 generation, diclofenac was about 1 order of magnitude more potent than meloxicam, indicated by a diclofenac EC50 (concentration of drug required to cause 50% of maximum effect) that was about 10 times lower than that of meloxicam (EC50 diclofenac single doses: 37.50+/-29.64; EC50 meloxicam single doses: 677.50+/-189.08). However, serum concentrations of meloxicam after administration of 15 mg were approximately 10-fold higher than those of diclofenac. Therefore there was no statistically significant difference in the area under the effect time curve (P = .115) and the mean effect (P = .424) between meloxicam and diclofenac. The EC50 of both drugs was significantly higher at steady state (diclofenac steady state: 87.07+/-55.24 ng/mL; meloxicam steady state: 1850.12+/-829.93 ng/mL) than after a single dose (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These data show that meloxicam inhibits TXB2 generation at clinically relevant doses, although less potently than diclofenac. Thus our data suggest that the COX-2 preference of meloxicam observed in vitro may not result in clinical advantages when the higher dose of 15 mg is needed. Because of the increase in EC50 at steady state, COX-1 is relatively spared when the lower dose of 7.5 mg is administered.
23554049	Furanodiene Presents Synergistic Anti-proliferative Activity With Paclitaxel Via Altering Cell Cycle and Integrin Signaling in 95-D Lung Cancer Cells.	Furanodiene (FUR) is a natural terpenoid isolated from Rhizoma Curcumae, a well-known Chinese medicinal herb that presents anti-proliferative activities in several cancer cell lines. Recently, we found that the combined treatment of FUR with paclitaxel (TAX) showed synergetic anti-proliferative activities in 95-D lung cancer cells. Herein, we showed that FUR reduced the cell numbers distributed in mitosis phase induced by TAX while increased those in G1 phase. The protein levels of cyclin D1, cyclin B1, CDK6 and c-Myc were all down-regulated in the group of combined treatment. The dramatically down-regulated expression of integrin β4, focal adhesion kinase and paxillin might partially contribute to the synergic effect. Though FUR alone obviously induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, this signaling pathway may not contribute to the synergetic anti-proliferative effect as the protein expression of CHOP and BIP was similar in FUR alone and combined treatment group.

1929324	Physiological effects of fenpropimorph on wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fenpropimorph-resistant mutants.	Fenpropimorph-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated by a gradient selection procedure. The mutants were cross-resistant to other morpholines (fenpropidin, dodemorph, tridemorph) and 15-azasterol, but were susceptible to azoles (miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole) and nystatin. In the absence of fenpropimorph, the major sterol produced by the mutants and the parental strain was ergosterol. In the presence of fenpropimorph, ignosterol (ergosta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol) was the major sterol produced by the mutants and the parental strain. The resistance to fenpropimorph involves two recessive genes, each of which allows a semiresistance, when they are isolated apart from one another. Strain JR4 (erg3 erg11), which produces 14-methylfecosterol [14 alpha-methyl-ergosta-8,24(28)-dien- 3-beta-ol) as the major sterol in the presence or absence of fenpropimorph, was also found to be resistant to the drug. The growth inhibitory effect of fenpropimorph on wild-type cells appears to be linked to the production of ignosterol. The uptake of exogenous sterol by wild-type cells was greatly enhanced in the presence of fenpropimorph. The growth inhibition caused by fenpropimorph could only be overcome with bulk levels of exogenous C-5,6-unsaturated sterols.
20083608	A fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based M2 muscarinic receptor sensor reveals rapid kinetics of allosteric modulation.	Allosteric modulators have been identified for several G protein-coupled receptors, most notably muscarinic receptors. To study their mechanism of action, we made use of a recently developed technique to generate fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors to monitor G protein-coupled receptor activation. Cyan fluorescent protein was fused to the C terminus of the M(2) muscarinic receptor, and a specific binding sequence for the small fluorescent compound fluorescein arsenical hairpin binder, FlAsH, was inserted into the third intracellular loop; the latter site was labeled in intact cells by incubation with FlAsH. We then measured FRET between the donor cyan fluorescent protein and the acceptor FlAsH in intact cells and monitored its changes in real time. Agonists such as acetylcholine and carbachol induced rapid changes in FRET, indicative of agonist-induced conformational changes. Removal of the agonists or addition of an antagonist caused a reversal of this signal with rate constants between 400 and 1100 ms. The allosteric ligands gallamine and dimethyl-W84 caused no changes in FRET when given alone, but increased FRET when given in the presence of an agonist, compatible with an inactivation of the receptors. The kinetics of these effects were very rapid, with rate constants of 80-100 ms and approximately 200 ms for saturating concentrations of gallamine and dimethyl-W84, respectively. Because these speeds are significantly faster than the responses to antagonists, these data indicate that gallamine and dimethyl-W84 are allosteric ligands and actively induce a conformation of the M(2) receptor with a reduced affinity for its agonists.
23535363	Interferon-γ Promoter Is Hypermethylated in Blood DNA from Workers with Confirmed Diisocyanate Asthma.	Risk factors have not been identified that determine susceptibility for development of diisocyanate-induced occupational asthma (DA). We hypothesized that diisocyanate (DI) exposure could modify gene promoter regions regulating transcription of cytokine mediators and thereby influence expression of DA. A cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the promoter methylation status of candidate genes in DI-exposed workers. Subjects consisted of 131 workers in three groups: 40 cases with DA confirmed by a positive specific inhalation challenge (SIC) (DA+), 41 exposed workers with lower respiratory symptoms and negative SIC (DA-), and 50 asymptomatic exposed workers (AWs). We studied four candidate genes (GSTM1, DUSP22, IFN-γ, and IL-4) for which altered promoter methylation has been previously investigated for relationships with a variety of other environmental exposures. Methylation status was determined using methylation-specific quantitative PCR performed on genomic DNA extracted from whole blood. Results showed that relative methylation of IFN-γ promoter was significantly increased in DA+ in comparison with both comparator groups (DA- and AW), and it exhibited good sensitivity (77.5%) and specificity (80%) for identifying DA workers in a multivariate predictive model after adjusting for type of DI exposure, smoking status, methacholine PC20, and gender. IL-4 promoter was slightly less methylated only in DA+ compared with AW among nonsmoking workers. Both GSTM1 and DUSP22 promoter methylations were found not associated with DA. Our finding suggests that exposure to occupational chemicals could play a heretofore undefined mechanistic role via epigenetic modification of specific genes in the promoter region.
23401165	Arsenic geochemistry in a biostimulated aquifer: An aqueous speciation study.	Stimulating microbial growth through the use of acetate injection wells at the former uranium mill site in Rifle, Colorado, USA, has been shown to decrease dissolved uranium (VI) concentrations through bacterial reduction to immobile uranium (IV). Bioreduction also changed the redox chemistry of site groundwater, altering the mobility of several other redox-sensitive elements present in the subsurface, including iron, sulfur, and arsenic. Following acetate amendment at the site, elevated concentrations of arsenic in the groundwater were observed. Ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used to determine the aqueous arsenic speciation. Upgradient samples, unexposed to acetate, showed low levels of arsenic (≈1 μM), with greater than 90% as arsenate (As[V]) and a small amount of arsenite (As[III]). Downgradient acetate-stimulated water samples had much higher levels of arsenic (up to 8 μM), and 4 additional thioarsenic species were present under sulfate-reducing conditions. These thioarsenic species demonstrate a strong correlation between arsenic release and sulfide concentrations in groundwater, and their formation may explain the elevated total arsenic concentrations. An alternative remediation approach, enhanced flushing of uranium, was accomplished by addition of bicarbonate and did not result in highly elevated arsenic concentrations.

23144001	Real-time fluorescence turn-on detection of alkaline phosphatase activity with a novel perylene probe.	A tetracationic perylene probe (probe 1) was designed and synthesized. Probe 1 was used for the real-time fluorescence turn-on assay of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and inhibitor screening. Probe 1 monomer fluorescence could be very efficiently quenched by ATP through the formation of an ATP/probe 1 complex. ALP triggered the degradation of ATP, the breakdown of the ATP/probe 1 complex, and the recovery of the probe 1 monomer fluorescence. In the presence of an ALP inhibitor, a decrease in fluorescence recovery was observed.
10698696	Antizyme inhibitor is rapidly induced in growth-stimulated mouse fibroblasts and releases ornithine decarboxylase from antizyme suppression.	Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) catalyses the first step in the synthesis of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine. The polyamines are essential for cell growth, but at elevated levels they may be tumorigenic, toxic, or may induce apoptosis. Therefore, ODC activity is highly regulated. It is induced when cells are stimulated to grow, and it is subjected to feedback inhibition by the polyamines. By causing ribosomal frameshifting, polyamines induce the synthesis of antizyme, a 23-kDa protein, which binds to ODC, inhibits its activity and promotes its degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Antizyme, in turn, is inhibited by antizyme inhibitor (AZI). We describe the cloning of a mouse AZI cDNA, encoding a protein with high homology to mouse ODC. Using purified recombinant proteins, we show that AZI (which has no ODC activity) can release enzymically active ODC from antizyme suppression in vitro. We also show that ODC reactivation takes place in mouse fibroblasts upon transient transfection with an AZI-expressing plasmid construct. Finally we demonstrate that the AZI mRNA content of mouse fibroblasts increases significantly within an hour of growth stimulation, i.e. much earlier than ODC transcripts. Our results indicate that induction of AZI synthesis may represent a means of rescuing ODC molecules that have been inactivated and tagged for degradation by antizyme, when culture conditions improve and polyamine production is needed for cell growth and proliferation.
19951374	Role of muscarinic receptor activation in regulating immune cell activity in nasal mucosa.	BACKGROUND: The prevalence of airway inflammatory disorders keeps rising; its pathogenic mechanism is still not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate the role of muscarinic receptor (M receptor) in regulating the immune cell activity in nasal mucosa by using surgical removed nasal mucosa from patients with nasal polyposis (NP) as a study platform. METHODS: Human nasal mucosal sample was collected from inferior turbinectomy of 86 patients with NP or/and allergic rhinitis. Expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), M receptor, OX40 ligand was measured in nasal mucosa by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, and Western blotting assay. RESULTS: When compared with non-NP (nNP) nasal mucosa, contents of TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha+ cells markedly increased in NP nasal mucosa; immune staining colocalized M3 receptor+ and TNF-alpha+ cells in NP nasal mucosa; exposure of isolated CD4+ T cells to methacholine induced the release of TNF-alpha. We also found CD11c+/M3 receptor+ cells in NP nasal mucosa. Methacholine increased the expression of OX40L in dendritic cells. Staphylococcal (S) aureus and S. enterotoxin B (SEB) were detected in NP nasal mucosa. Exposure of dendritic cells or naive CD4+ T cells to SEB initiated the expression of M3 receptor at mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present data demonstrate that parasympathetic activity has the capacity to activate dendritic cells to release OX40 ligand, the latter induces CD4+ T cells to produce IL-4 and TNF-alpha that may further contribute to the pathogenesis of NP.
17363544	A nonfucosylated anti-HER2 antibody augments antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in breast cancer patients.	PURPOSE: Removal of fucose residues from the oligosaccharides of human antibody is a powerful approach to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a potential important antitumor mechanism of therapeutic antibodies. To provide clinically relevant evidence of this mechanism, we investigated ADCC of a fucose-negative version of trastuzumab [anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) humanized antibody] using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from breast cancer patients as effector cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty volunteers, including 20 breast cancer patients and 10 normal healthy control donors, were recruited randomly, and aliquots of peripheral blood were collected. ADCC of commercial trastuzumab (fucosylated) and its fucose-negative version were measured using PBMCs drawn from the volunteers as effector cells and two breast cancer cell lines with different HER2 expression levels as target cells. Relationships between cytotoxicity and characteristics of the patients, such as content of natural killer cells in PBMCs, type of therapy, FCGR3A genotypes, etc. were also analyzed. RESULTS: ADCC was significantly enhanced with the fucose-negative antibody compared with the fucose-positive antibody using PBMCs from either normal donors or breast cancer patients. Enhancement of ADCC was observed irrespective of the various clinical backgrounds of the patients, even in the chemotherapy cohort that presented with a reduced number of natural killer cells and weaker ADCC. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that the use of fucose-negative antibodies may improve the therapeutic effects of anti-HER2 therapy for patients independent of clinical backgrounds.
11056242	Effect of hormonal agents on monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression by endometrial epithelial cells of women with endometriosis.	OBJECTIVE: To assess whether hormonal agents used in the medical treatment of endometriosis, such as danazol and GnRH agonist, exert direct regulatory action on monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression by endometrial epithelial cells. DESIGN: Primary cultures of epithelial cells isolated from human endometrium were exposed to different concentrations of cytokines and steroid hormone analogs. Expression of MCP-1 was analyzed at the levels of protein and messenger RNA. SETTING: Gynecology clinic and laboratory of endocrinology of reproduction. PATIENT(S): Women presenting for infertility or pelvic pain in whom endometriosis was diagnosed by using laparoscopy. INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial tissue biopsy performed at laparoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Secretion of MCP-1 protein was measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA steady-state levels were measured by performing Northern blot analysis. RESULT(S): Buserelin acetate, a GnRH agonist (0.1-10 ng/mL), had no significant effect on MCP-1 expression, whereas danazol (10(-7)-10(-5) M), a testosterone analog, and dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid hormone (10(-12)-10(-6)M), showed a direct and a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on MCP-1 expression. This effect occurred at the level of protein and mRNA. CONCLUSION(S): The findings of the study may affect understanding of the mechanisms by which hormonal treatments act on endometriosis and influence its clinical manifestations.
