17651117	Inhibition of platelet receptors involved in neutrophil-platelet interaction in model cardiopulmonary bypass.	We investigated the interactions between neutrophils, platelets, and artificial surfaces, and whether blocking of relevant receptors on platelets reduced unwanted activation responses in model cardiopulmonary bypass. Isolated neutrophils and platelets resuspended in heparin-anticoagulated plasma were recirculated with and without blocking antibodies to CD62P, CD42b, or junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C) in polyvinyl chloride tubing using a roller pump. Platelet adhesion to the tubing was inhibited by anti-CD42b and anti-CD62P, and adhesion of neutrophils by anti-JAM-C. Formation of platelet-neutrophil and platelet aggregates was reduced by anti-CD62P. Anti-JAM-C decreased platelet-neutrophil aggregation at low concentrations and platelet macroaggregates at high concentrations. Anti-CD62P increased neutrophil CD11b expression but not degranulation. Anti-JAM-C substantially increased neutrophil degranulation and slightly increased CD11b expression. Platelet activation increased when CD62P was blocked and decreased with anti-CD42b antibody. High-dose anti-JAM-C reduced platelet activation. In conclusion, inhibiting platelet and neutrophil-platelet interactions had useful effects but no single blocking antibody seemed capable of inducing only beneficial effects.
16324695	Protein kinase C potentiates homologous desensitization of the beta2-adrenoceptor in bovine tracheal smooth muscle.	Preincubation (30 min) of bovine tracheal smooth muscle with various concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 microM) of fenoterol decreased isoprenaline-induced maximal relaxation (E(max)) of methacholine-contracted preparations in a concentration dependent fashion, indicating desensitization of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor. Preincubation with 1 microM of the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a small but significant decrease in isoprenaline-induced E(max), indicating activated PKC-mediated heterologous beta(2)-adrenoceptor desensitization. To investigate the capacity of activated PKC to regulate homologous desensitization, we incubated the smooth muscle strips with the combination of both 1 microM PMA and 1 microM fenoterol. This combined treatment synergistically decreased the isoprenaline-induced maximal relaxation, as compared to the individual effects of PMA and fenoterol alone, indicating a common pathway for heterologous and homologous desensitization. Moreover, the specific PKC-inhibitor 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl) maleimide (GF 109203X) markedly increased the potency and E(max) of isoprenaline for all conditions used, including control conditions, and the synergistic effects of PMA and fenoterol were completely prevented. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that homologous desensitization of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor can be enhanced by PKC activation. For the first time we have provided evidence that this concept is functionally operative in airway smooth muscle, and it may explain the reduced bronchodilator response to beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists in patients with asthma during a severe exacerbation.
12901032	Interaction of rofecoxib and celecoxib with warfarin.	The interaction of celecoxib and rofecoxib with warfarin was studied. Patients stable on warfarin therapy and concurrently taking a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor comparator (traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, salsalate, or acetaminophen) randomly received celecoxib 200 mg/day or rofecoxib 25 mg/day for three weeks. After a one-week washout period, the patients were crossed over to treatment with the opposite COX-2 inhibitor for three more weeks. The International Normalized Ratio (INR) was measured at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, and 3 of therapy with each COX-2 inhibitor by testing blood samples obtained by finger stick. Data for 16 patients were analyzed. The INR increased by 13%, 6%, and 5% on average in patients taking celecoxib at weeks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and by 5%, 9%, and 5% in patients taking rofecoxib. Changes in the INR were statistically significant at week 1 for celecoxib and at week 2 for rofecoxib. Of the 12 subjects who had a clinically significant > or = 15% change in the INR while receiving either COX-2 inhibitor, 4 showed this change for both agents. Adverse drug reactions were similar for each COX-2 inhibitor, but the rate of edema requiring medical intervention was higher in the rofecoxib group. Significant increases in the INR were observed in patients who were stable on warfarin therapy after the addition of therapy with rofecoxib or celecoxib.
19372559	Chromatin-associated proteins HMGB1/2 and PDIA3 trigger cellular response to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage.	The identification of new molecular components of the DNA damage signaling cascade opens novel avenues to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. High-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) is a DNA damage sensor responsive to the incorporation of nonnatural nucleosides into DNA; several nuclear and cytosolic proteins are functionally integrated with HMGB1 in the context of DNA damage response. The functional role of HMGB1 and HMGB1-associated proteins (high-mobility group protein B2, HMGB2; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH; protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, PDIA3; and heat shock 70 kDa protein 8, HSPA8) in DNA damage response was assessed in human carcinoma cells A549 and UO31 by transient knockdown with short interfering RNAs. Using the cell proliferation assay, we found that knockdown of HMGB1-associated proteins resulted in 8-fold to 50-fold decreased chemosensitivity of A549 cells to cytarabine. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent microscopy were used to evaluate genotoxic stress markers in knocked-down cancer cells after 24 to 72 hours of incubation with 1 micromol/L of cytarabine. Our results dissect the roles of HMGB1-associated proteins in DNA damage response: HMGB1 and HMGB2 facilitate p53 phosphorylation after exposure to genotoxic stress, and PDIA3 has been found essential for H2AX phosphorylation (no gamma-H2AX accumulated after 24-72 hours of incubation with 1 micromol/L of cytarabine in PDIA3 knockdown cells). We conclude that phosphorylation of p53 and phosphorylation of H2AX occur in two distinct branches of the DNA damage response. These findings identify new molecular components of the DNA damage signaling cascade and provide novel promising targets for chemotherapeutic intervention.
10727715	The role of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors on the modulation of acute fluoxetine-induced changes in extracellular 5-HT: the mechanism of action of (+/-)pindolol.	Some clinical evidence has suggested that (+/-)pindolol can be effective at producing a shortened time to onset of antidepressant activity when co-administered with a serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This effect has been attributed to the antagonist effects of pindolol at the 5-HT(1A) receptor. In the present study, we compared the pharmacology of (+/-)pindolol, WAY-100635 (a 5-HT(1A) antagonist), GR127935 (a 5-HT(1B/1D) antagonist), and isamoltane (a 5-HT(1B) antagonist), when given acutely in combination with fluoxetine, using in vivo microdialysis in the frontal cortex of the freely moving rat. We have determined that the acute fluoxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT can be augmented by (+/-)pindolol, WAY100635, GR127935 and isamoltane with maximum increases of 216+/-32%, 235+/-49%, 240+/-18% and 171+/-47% of preinjection control levels, respectively. Combination of both 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B/1D) autoreceptor antagonists with fluoxetine produced additive increases in extracellular 5-HT (i.e. WAY100635+GR127935+fluoxetine and WAY100635+isamoltane+fluoxetine produced a four- and five-fold potentiation, respectively), suggesting that this strategy may be useful in further augmenting the action of a SSRI in the treatment of depression. In addition, by comparing the combined administration of (+/-)pindolol with either WAY100635, GR127935 or isamoltane, we have determined that (+/-)pindolol produces much of its acute potentiation of fluoxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT via its action at the 5-HT(1B/D) receptor in addition to any activity it has at the presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor.
9890894	Common and specific determinants for fibroblast growth factors in the ectodomain of the receptor kinase complex.	The assembly and activation of oligomeric complexes of FGF, the transmembrane receptor kinase (FGFR), and heparan sulfate transmit intracellular signals regulating growth and function of cells. An understanding of the structural relationships between the three subunits and their redundancy and specificity is essential for understanding the ubiquitous FGF signaling system in health and disease. Previously, we reported that a primary heparin or heparan sulfate binding site resides in a distinct sequence in immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II of the three modules of FGFR. Here we report that in the absence of flanking sequences, isolated Ig module II of FGFR1 supports the binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7 in respective order of affinity. None of the three FGFs detectably bind Ig module I or the IIIb and IIIc splice variants of Ig module III in the absence of flanking sequences. Ig module I and the C-terminus of Ig module III are dispensable for high-affinity binding of FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7. Alterations in highly conserved Ig module II in the heparin binding domain and substitution of individual sequence domains spanning the entire sequence of Ig module II with those from Ig module I obliterated FGF binding. Addition of a specific number of FGFR sequences to the C-terminus of Ig module II resulted in a gain in affinity for FGF-7. Several site-specific alterations in the C-terminus of full-length FGFR1IIIc, an isoform that otherwise absolutely rejects FGF-7, resulted in gain of FGF-7 binding. These results suggest that a complex of Ig module II and heparan sulfate is the base common active core of the FGFR ectodomain and that flanking structural domains modify FGF affinity and determine specificity.
23298863	Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of hedgehog inhibitor TAK-441 for the inhibition of Gli1 messenger RNA expression and antitumor efficacy in xenografted tumor model mice.	6-Ethyl-N-[1-(hydroxyacetyl)piperidin-4-yl]-1-methyl-4-oxo-5-(2-oxo-2-phenylethyl)-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridine-2-carboxamide (TAK-441) is a potent, selective hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitor that binds to Smo and is being developed for the treatment of cancer. The objectives of these studies were to explore the possibility of establishing of a link between the pharmacokinetics of TAK-441 and the responses of Gli1 mRNA in tumor-associated stromal or skin cells and the antitumor effect of hedgehog inhibition. To this end, we built pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models that describe the relationship of the concentrations of TAK-441 plasma to the responses of Gli1 mRNA in the tumor (target) and skin (surrogate) and to tumor growth inhibition in mice bearing xenografts of human pancreatic tumors (PAN-04). The responses of Gli1 mRNA and tumor growth were described by an indirect response model and an exponential tumor growth model, respectively. The IC50 values for Gli1 mRNA inhibition in the tumor and skin by TAK-441 were estimated to be 0.0457 and 0.113 μg/ml, respectively. The IC90 value for tumor growth inhibition was estimated to be 0.68 μg/ml. These results suggest that a >83% inhibition of Gli1 mRNA expression in the skin or a >94% inhibition of Gli1 mRNA expression in the tumor would be required to sufficiently inhibit (>90%) hedgehog-related tumor growth in the xenografted model mice. We conclude that Gli1 mRNA expression in the tumor and skin could be a useful biomarker for predicting the antitumor effect of hedgehog inhibitors.
23142699	Proto-oncogene PIM-1 is a novel estrogen receptor target associating with high grade breast tumors.	We searched ERα cistromes of MCF-7 breast cancer cells for previously unrecognized ERα targets and identified proto-oncogene PIM-1 as a novel potential target gene. We show that the expression of PIM-1 is induced in response to estradiol in MCF-7 cells and that the induction is mediated by ERα-regulated enhancers located distally upstream from the gene. In keeping with the growth-promoting role of the PIM-1, depletion of the PIM-1 attenuated the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells, which was paralleled with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor CDKN1A and CDKN2B expression. Analysis of PIM-1 expression between invasive breast tumors and benign breast tissue samples showed that elevated PIM-1 expression is associated with malignancy and a higher tumor grade. In sum, identification of PIM-1 as an ERα target gene adds a novel potential mechanism by which estrogens can contribute to breast cancer cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.
2568748	Nonthrombolytic intervention in acute myocardial infarction.	Alternative interventions are available for patients in whom thrombolytic therapy is inappropriate after an acute myocardial infarction. Administration of a beta blocker within the first 24 hours of the patient's admission to the coronary care unit can reduce overall morbidity and mortality within the first 7 days by about 15%. Maintenance therapy with an oral beta blocker can reduce mortality within the succeeding 3 years by about 25%. Esmolol, a unique cardioselective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocker with a half-life of 9 minutes, can enable some patients with relative contraindications to beta blockers to nevertheless benefit from early beta-blocking therapy. It also is useful in screening patients for subsequent therapy with beta blockers. Those who tolerate the esmolol infusion can be given a long-acting beta blocker. For patients who exhibit intolerance to esmolol, the infusion can be terminated with rapid return to baseline hemodynamics.
8142113	Adapalene, a new chemical entity with retinoid activity.	Adapalene is a novel chemical entity which, in terms of pharmacology, behaves similar to tretinoin, but is chemically and photochemically stable. It has a particular selectivity profile for the known nuclear retinoic acid receptors with low affinity for RAR alpha and no transactivating potential for RXR alpha. This receptor profile could imply that adapalene, in contrast to tretinoin, affects the terminal differentiation pathway of epidermal cells rather than their proliferation. Furthermore, adapalene does not bind to members of the cellular retinoic acid binding protein family. Adapalene has comedolytic activity in the topical rhino mouse model. It exerts a moderate-to-potent anti-inflammatory effect in a series of in vitro and in vivo models. In comparative clinical studies involving 72 acne patients, the efficacy of adapalene was comparable, if not superior, to tretinoin, but adapalene was better tolerated. The data reviewed in this paper indicate that adapalene should be particularly beneficial in the treatment of acne.
10727528	Aspirin and sodium salicylate inhibit endothelin ETA receptors by an allosteric type of mechanism.	Aspirin is a commonly used drug with a wide pharmacological spectrum including antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective actions. This study shows that aspirin and sodium salicylate, its major blood metabolite, reverse contractile actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in isolated rat aorta and human mammary arteries. They also prevent the intracellular Ca(2+) mobilizing action of ET-1 in cultured endothelial cells but not those of neuromedin B or UTP. Inhibition of the actions of ET-1 by salicylates is apparently competitive. Salicylates inhibit (125)I-ET-1 binding to recombinant rat ETA receptors. Salicylic acid promotes dissociation of (125)I-ET-1 ETA receptor complexes both in the absence and the presence of unlabeled ET-1. It has no influence on the rate of association of (125)I-ET-1 to ETA receptors. Salicylates do not promote dissociation of (125)I-ET-1 ETB receptor complexes. Salicylates potentiate relaxing actions of receptor antagonists such as bosentan. It is concluded that salicylates are allosteric inhibitors of ETA receptors. The results also suggest that: 1) irreversible ET-1 binding probably limits actions of receptor antagonists in vivo, and 2) an association of salicylates and ETA receptor antagonists should be used to evaluate the physiopathological role of ET-1 and may be of therapeutic interest in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.
23545458	Total saponins of Panax notoginseng enhance VEGF and relative receptors signals and promote angiogenesis derived from rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.	ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Total saponins of Panax notoginseng (tPNS), main constituents extracted from Panax Notoginseng, a highly valued traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to increase protein expression and the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The effects of tPNS on angiogenesis were studied in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: rBMSCs were stimulated by tPNS of 48h. The mRNA expression levels of VEGF-A, Flt-1 and Kdr in rBMSCs were determined by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). rBMSCs were induced to differentiate into endothelial-like cells and the effects of tPNS on the angiogenesis ability of rBMSCs and rBMSCs after endothelial differentiation were assayed by a Matrigel model in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: tPNS (100μg/ml) significantly enhanced the mRNA expression level of VEGF-A and Kdr compared to the control group, while they had no obvious effect on the expression of Flt-1. tPNS (1μg/ml and 100μg/ml) significantly increased capillary network forming of rBMSCs after endothelial differentiation in Matrigel in vitro. tPNS (50μg/kg, 100μg/kg and 150μg/kg) also significantly increased angiogenesis induced by the combination with implantation of rBMSCs and Matrigel in vivo. CONCLUSION: tPNS up-regulate VEGF-A and Kdr expression, and promote angiogenesis in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.
23150495	Ablation of Egr2-positive cells in male mouse anterior pituitary leads to atypical isolated GH deficiency.	In this study, we have investigated the expression and function of the transcription factor early growth response factor 2 (Egr2)/Krox20 in the developing anterior pituitary. Egr2 is initially expressed in all differentiating hormonal cells types, but its expression is mostly restricted to the somatotroph lineage after birth. Egr2 knockout results in anterior pituitary hypoplasia. However, the analysis of a conditional mutant demonstrates that this phenotype does not originate from a lack of Egr2 expression in the pituitary. Using an Egr2 allele driving a Cre-activable toxin gene, we performed a genetic ablation of Egr2-positive cells in the pituitary. During the postnatal period, this ablation leads to specific and progressive depletion of the somatotroph population, creating a novel model of early-onset isolated GH deficiency (GHD). Mutant animals were subjected to a complete metabolic analysis, revealing atypical and expected features. Consistent with an adult-onset isolated GHD model, mutant animals are hypoglycemic and display increased insulin sensitivity and glucose clearance. This latter phenotype is in contrast to the glucose intolerance observed in another early-onset GHD model. Surprisingly, increased insulin sensitivity is not accompanied by a modified balance between fat and lean tissues, but by reduced metabolic adaptability between glucose and lipid oxidation conditions. This suggests that the relationship between these metabolic features and insulin sensitivity should be reconsidered. In conclusion, our mutant may be a valuable genetic model with which to study the effects of long-term GH deficiency, in conditions of normal pancreatic function and unaffected balance between fat and glucose metabolism.
16213084	Functional characteristics of H+ -dependent nicotinate transport in primary cultures of astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex.	In the present study, we report the characteristics of H(+)-coupled nicotinate transport in primary cultures of astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex. The [(3)H]nicotinate transport in rat astrocytes increased up to a pH 5.5. The nicotinic acid uptake at pH 6.0 was both energy-dependent and saturable with a Michaelis constant (K(t)) of 2.8+/-0.4 mM and the maximal uptake rate (V(max)) of 31+/-3.2 nmol/mg protein/10 min. This process was reduced by a protonophore, carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and a typical monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) inhibitor, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, suggesting that nicotinate uptake by rat astrocytes is mediated by H(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transport system. [(3)H]Nicotinate transport in rat astrocytes was significantly inhibited by various monocarboxylic acids such as l-lactic acid and pyruvic acid with a relatively low affinity (K(i)>10 mM). On the other hand, the uptake process of l-lactic acid was also saturable with a high-affinity component (K(t)=0.27 mM) and a low-affinity component (K(t)=35.9 mM). Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed that three MCT subtypes, MCT1/Slc16a1, MCT2/Slc16a7, and MCT4/Slc16a3, were expressed in these cells. Because l-lactate reduced to 67% of the nicotinate uptake even at 10mM, it is unlikely that nicotinate uptake in rat astrocytes is mediated by MCT1 and/or MCT2. These results provide biochemical evidence of a H(+)-coupled and saturable transport system, presumed to be a low-affinity monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 or other unknown H(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transport system, for nicotinate in rat cerebrocortical astrocytes.
23587425	Potency switch between CHK1 and MK2: Discovery of imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine- and imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine-based kinase inhibitors.	Chemistry has been developed to access both imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines and imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidines. Small structural modifications in both series led to a switch of potency between two kinases involved in mediating cell cycle checkpoint control, CHK1 and MK2.
11792932	Aromatase inhibitors for male infertility.	PURPOSE: Testosterone-to-estradiol ratio levels in infertile men improve during treatment with the aromatase inhibitor, testolactone, and resulting changes in semen parameters. We evaluated the effect of anastrozole, a more selective aromatase inhibitor, on the hormonal and semen profiles of infertile men with abnormal baseline testosterone-to-estradiol ratios. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 140 subfertile men with abnormal testosterone-to-estradiol ratios were treated with 100 to 200 mg. testolactone daily or 1 mg. anastrozole daily. Changes in testosterone, estradiol, testosterone-to-estradiol ratios and semen parameters were evaluated during therapy. The effect of obesity, diagnosis of the Klinefelter syndrome, and presence of varicocele and/or history of varicocele repair on treatment results was studied. RESULTS: Men treated with testolactone had an increase in testosterone-to-estradiol ratios during therapy (mean plus or minus standard error of the mean 5.3 +/- 0.2 versus 12.4 +/- 1.1, p <0.001). This change was confirmed in subgroups of men with the Klinefelter syndrome, a history of varicocele repair and those with varicocele. A total of 12 oligospermic men had semen analysis before and during testolactone treatment with an increase in sperm concentration (5.5 versus 11.2 million sperm per ml., p <0.01), motility (14.7% versus 21.0%, p <0.05), morphology (6.5% versus 12.8%, p = 0.05), and motility index (606.3 versus 1685.2 million motile sperm per ejaculate, respectively, p <0.05) appreciated. During anastrozole treatment, similar changes in the testosterone-to-estradiol ratios were seen (7.2 +/- 0.3 versus 18.1 +/- 1.0, respectively, p <0.001). This improvement of hormonal parameters was noted for all subgroups except those patients with the Klinefelter syndrome. A total of 25 oligospermic men with semen analysis before and during anastrozole treatment had an increase in semen volume (2.9 versus 3.5 ml., p <0.05), sperm concentration (5.5 versus 15.6 million sperm per ml., p <0.001) and motility index (832.8 versus 2930.8 million motile sperm per ejaculate, respectively, p <0.005). These changes were similar to those observed in men treated with testolactone. No significant difference in serum testosterone levels during treatment with testolactone and anastrozole was observed. However, the anastrozole treatment group did have a statistically better improvement of serum estradiol concentration and testosterone-to-estradiol ratios (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Men who are infertile with a low serum testosterone-to-estradiol ratio can be treated with an aromatase inhibitor. With treatment, an increase in testosterone-to-estradiol ratio occurred in association with increased semen parameters. Anastrozole and testolactone have similar effects on hormonal profiles and semen analysis. Anastrazole appears to be at least as effective as testolactone for treating men with abnormal testosterone-to-estradiol ratios, except for the subset with the Klinefelter syndrome, who appeared to be more effectively treated with testolactone.
11972613	Cysteinyl leukotriene-dependent interleukin-5 production leading to eosinophilia during late asthmatic response in guinea-pigs.	BACKGROUND: Allergic airway eosinophilia is suppressed by cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptor (CysLT1 receptor) antagonists in several species including humans and guinea-pigs, suggesting that CysLTs are directly or indirectly involved in induction of the response. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of CysLT antagonists (pranlukast and MCI-826) on antigen inhalation-induced eosinophilia in peripheral blood and lung, and on IL-5 activity in serum during late increase of airway resistance (late asthmatic response, LAR) in sensitized guinea-pigs. METHODS: Guinea-pigs inhaled ovalbumin (OVA) + Al(OH)3 and OVA mists alternately for sensitization and challenge, respectively, once every 2 weeks. At the fifth challenge, the effects of CysLT antagonists and an anti-IL-5 antibody (TRFK-5) on the occurrence of LAR, and blood and lung eosinophilia, which appeared at 5 h after challenge, were examined. The time-course of IL-5 activity in the serum after the challenge was evaluated by measuring in vitro 'eosinophil survival prolongation activity'. The influence of CysLT antagonists on IL-5 activity was assessed. RESULTS: CysLT antagonists and TRFK-5 completely abolished blood and lung eosinophilia. LAR was suppressed by both MCI-826 and TRFK-5 by 40-50%. Sera obtained from sensitized, challenged animals 3 h and 4 h after challenge induced an obvious prolongation of eosinophil survival. The activity of the sera was completely neutralized by prior exposure to TRFK-5, suggesting that it reflected IL-5 activity. Increased IL-5 activity in the serum was inhibited by both pranlukast and MCI-826 by over 90%. CONCLUSIONS: CysLTs produced after antigen provocation sequentially induced IL-5 production from some immune component cells via CysLT1 receptor activation. Thus, it is likely that CysLTs indirectly cause antigen-induced eosinophilia through IL-5 production.
12123767	A novel SCN5A arrhythmia mutation, M1766L, with expression defect rescued by mexiletine.	OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A, cause congenital long QT syndrome (LQT3), Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and conduction disease by distinct cellular and clinical electrophysiological phenotypes. METHODS: Postmortem molecular analysis of SCN5A was conducted on an infant who presented shortly after birth with self-terminating torsades de pointes. The infant was treated with lidocaine, propranolol, and mexiletine and was stable for 16 months manifesting only a prolonged QT interval. The infant collapsed suddenly following presumed viral gastroenteritis, was found in 2:1 AV block, and was subsequently declared brain dead. Genomic DNA was subjected to SCN5A mutational analyses and DNA sequencing revealing a novel, spontaneous germline missense mutation, M1766L. The M1766L mutation was engineered into the hH1a clone by site-directed mutagenesis, transfected into embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293), and studied by voltage clamp. RESULTS: The M1766L mutation caused a significant decrease in the sodium channel expression. Co-expression with beta1 subunit, incubation at low temperature, and most effectively incubation with mexiletine partially 'rescued' the defective expression. In addition to this pronounced loss of function, M1766L also showed a 10-fold increase in the persistent late sodium current. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that M1766L-SCN5A channel dysfunction may contribute to the basis of lethal arrhythmias, displays an overlapping electrophysiological phenotype, and represents the first sodium channelopathy rescued by drug.
12719755	Angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan and the defence reaction in the anaesthetised rat. Effect on the carotid chemoreflex.	Modulation at the level of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) appears to be an effective way of controlling cardiovascular reflexes. Angiotensin II acting on angiotensin AT1 receptors at the central nervous system appears to have an important role in these modulatory processes. The hypothalamic defence area (HDA) is a potential source of descending fibres containing angiotensin II that innervate the NTS. We investigated the effect of AT1 receptor blockade in the NTS on the response to stimulation of HDA in anaesthetised rats treated with the neuromuscular blocking agent pancuronium bromide. The characteristic increase in heart rate, blood pressure and phrenic nerve activity evoked by electrical stimulation of HDA is decreased by the microinjection of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan into the NTS and the cardiovascular response to carotid body chemical stimulation is also reduced. These results support the hypothesis that AT1 receptors in the NTS play a role in the modulation of cardiovascular reflexes, and modify the influence exerted on the processing of these reflexes by other areas of the central nervous system.
15723099	The dextromethorphan analog dimemorfan attenuates kainate-induced seizures via sigma1 receptor activation: comparison with the effects of dextromethorphan.	In a previous study, we demonstrated that a dextromethorphan analog, dimemorfan, has neuroprotective effects. Dextromethorphan and dimemorfan are high-affinity ligands at sigma1 receptors. Dextromethorphan has moderate affinities for phencyclidine sites, while dimemorfan has very low affinities for such sites, suggesting that these sites are not essential for the anticonvulsant actions of dimemorfan. Kainate (KA) administration (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) produced robust convulsions lasting 4-6 h in rats. Pre-treatment with dimemorfan (12 or 24 mg kg(-1)) reduced seizures in a dose-dependent manner. Dimemorfan pre-treatment also attenuated the KA-induced increases in c-fos/c-jun expression, activator protein (AP)-1 DNA-binding activity, and loss of cells in the CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus. These effects of dimemorfan were comparable to those of dextromethorphan. The anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or dimemorfan was significantly counteracted by a selective sigma1 receptor antagonist BD 1047, suggesting that the anticonvulsant action of dextromethorphan or dimemorfan is, at least in part, related to sigma1 receptor-activated modulation of AP-1 transcription factors. We asked whether dimemorfan produces the behavioral side effects seen with dextromethorphan or dextrorphan (a phencyclidine-like metabolite of dextromethorphan). Conditioned place preference and circling behaviors were significantly increased in mice treated with phencyclidine, dextrorphan or dextromethorphan, while mice treated with dimemorfan showed no behavioral side effects. Our results suggest that dimemorfan is equipotent to dextromethorphan in preventing KA-induced seizures, while it may lack behavioral effects, such as psychotomimetic reactions.
23572389	Hypermethylation of P15, P16, and E-cadherin genes in ovarian cancer.	Both p16 and p15 proteins are inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases that prevent the cell going through the G1/S phase transaction. E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates calcium-dependent interactions between adjacent epithelial cells. Two groups of patients were selected: the first group suffered from epithelial serous ovarian tumors and the second group suffered from benign ovarian lesions; ovarian tissue samples from all the subjects (benign and malignant) were subjected to methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for methylated and unmethylated alleles of the genes (E-cadherin, p15, and p16). Results obtained showed that aberrant methylation of p15 and p16 genes were detected in 64.29 and 50% of ovarian cancer patients, while E-cadherin hypermethylation was detected in 78.57% of ovarian cancer patients. Methylation of E-cadherin was significantly correlated with different stage of disease (p < 0.05). It was found that the risk of E-cadherin hypermethylation was 1.347-fold, while risk of p15 hypermethylation was 1.543-fold and p16 was 1.2-fold among patients with ovarian cancer than that among patients with benign ovarian lesions. In conclusion, Dysfunction of the cell cycle and/or the cell-cell adhesion molecule plays a role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and that the analysis of the methylation of p15 and E-cadherin genes can provide clinically important evidence on which to base the treatment.
23314054	Fragment-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of N-substituted-5-(4-isopropylthiophenol)-2-hydroxynicotinamide derivatives as novel Mcl-1 inhibitors.	We have previously reported a nanomolar inhibitor of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein, 3-thiomorpholin-8-oxo-8H-acenaphtho [1,2-b] pyrrole-9-carbonitrile (S1). S1 plays its function by binding to the BH3 groove of Mcl-1. Basing on this spacial structural characteristic, we developed a novel class of Mcl-1 inhibitor using fragment-based drug discovery approach. By dissecting S1, we identified the compound 4 with a 2-hydroxypyridine core as the starting fragment. In the following molecular growth, we used the ligand efficiency evaluation and fit quality score to assess the fragments. A novel potent compound, N-benzyl-5-(4-isopropylthiophenol)-2-hydroxyl nicotinamide (12c), which binds Mcl-1 with an IC(50) value of 54 nM was obtained. Compound 12c demonstrated a better aqueous solubility than S1.
1666997	[Preclinical pharmacology of amoxapine and amitriptyline. Implications of serotoninergic and opiodergic systems in their central effect in rats].	The effects of two antidepressant drugs, amoxapine and amitriptyline, that belong to distinct chemical classes, have been examined on various biochemical parameters related to serotoninergic and opioidergic neurotransmission in the rat brain and spinal cord. In vitro binding studies showed that both amoxapine and amitriptyline interact in the nanomolar range with 5-HT2 receptors labelled by [3H]ketanserin in cortical membranes. By contrast, neither amoxapine nor amitriptyline can be considered as possible ligands of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors because their affinities for these sites are in the micromolar range (or even worse). Interestingly, amoxapine binds with a good affinity (IC50 = 0.30 microM) to 5-HT3 receptors labelled by [3H]zacopride in cortical membranes. Complementary experiments using the 5-HT3-dependent Bezold-Jarisch reflex confirmed that amoxapine really acts in vivo as a 5-HT3 antagonist (IC50 = 50 micrograms/kg i.v.), whereas amitriptyline is essentially inactive on 5-HT3 receptors. The second part of this study consisted of looking for possible changes in central 5-HT receptors 24 h after either a single or a repeated (for 14 days) treatment with amoxapine (10 mg/kg i.p. each day) or amitriptyline (10 mg/kg i.p.). A marked decrease in the density of 5-HT2 receptors was found in the cerebral cortex in both treatment groups. By contrast, neither 5-HT1A nor 5-HT1B receptors were significantly affected in any brain region studied. Finally we explored whether acute and/or chronic administration of amoxapine or amitriptyline affected the levels of opioid peptides and the mu and delta classes of opioid receptors in various regions of the brain and the spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23402628	Oxidation of tertiary amine-derivatized surfaces to control protein adhesion.	Selective oxidation of ω-tertiary amine self-assembled thiol monolayers to tertiary amine N-oxides is shown to transform the adhesion of model proteins lysozyme and fibrinogen upon them. Efficient preparation of both secondary and tertiary linker amides as judged by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water droplet contact angle was achieved with an improved amide bond formation on gold quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors using 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl hexafluorophosphate methanaminium uronium (HATU). Oxidation with hydrogen peroxide was similarly assessed, and adhesion of lysozyme and fibrinogen from phosphate buffered saline was then assayed by QCM and imaged by AFM. Tertiary amine-functionalized sensors adsorbed multilayers of aggregated lysozyme, whereas tertiary amine N-oxides and triethylene glycol-terminated monolayers are consistent with small protein aggregates. The surface containing a dimethylamine N-oxide headgroup and ethyl secondary amide linker showed the largest difference in adsorption of both proteins. Oxidation of tertiary amine decorated surfaces therefore holds the potential for selective deposition of proteins and cells through masking and other patterning techniques.
10640321	The antitussive activity of delta-opioid receptor stimulation in guinea pigs.	In this study, the activity of the delta-opioid receptor subtype-selective agonist, SB 227122, was investigated in a guinea pig model of citric acid-induced cough. Parenteral administration of selective agonists of the delta-opioid receptor (SB 227122), mu-opioid receptor (codeine and hydrocodone), and kappa-opioid receptor (BRL 52974) produced dose-related inhibition of citric acid-induced cough with ED(50) values of 7.3, 5.2, 5.1, and 5.3 mg/kg, respectively. The nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (3 mg/kg, i.m.), attenuated the antitussive effects of codeine or SB 227122, indicating that the antitussive activity of both compounds is opioid receptor-mediated. The delta-receptor antagonist, SB 244525 (10 mg/kg, i.p.), inhibited the antitussive effect of SB 227122 (20 mg/kg, i.p.). In contrast, combined pretreatment with beta-funaltrexamine (mu-receptor antagonist; 20 mg/kg, s.c.) and norbinaltorphimine (kappa-receptor antagonist; 20 mg/kg, s.c.), at doses that inhibited the antitussive activity of mu- and kappa-receptor agonists, respectively, was without effect on the antitussive response of SB 227122 (20 mg/kg, i.p.). The sigma-receptor antagonist rimcazole (3 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited the antitussive effect of dextromethorphan (30 mg/kg, i.p.), a sigma-receptor agonist, but not that of SB 227122. These studies provide compelling evidence that the antitussive effects of SB 227122 in this guinea pig cough model are mediated by agonist activity at the delta-opioid receptor.
23504356	Pharmacotherapy for the core symptoms in autistic disorder: current status of the research.	The current review covers extant literature on pharmacotherapy for core symptoms of autism. The core symptoms of autism include impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors. There are no known efficacious treatments for the core social symptoms, although effects on repetitive behaviors are indicated with some data. While studies of fenfluramine, secretin, opiates, and mood stabilizers generally find no effect, mixed results suggest more research is needed on antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics. Newer lines of research, including cholinergic and glutamatergic agents and oxytocin, will be of considerable interest in the future. However, research on the treatment of core symptoms is plagued by limitations in study design, statistical power, and other issues inherent to the study of treatments for autism (e.g., heterogeneity of the disorder) that continue to prevent the elucidation of efficacious treatments.
23506741	A novel benzo[d]imidazole derivate prevents the development of dextran sulfate sodium-induced murine experimental colitis via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.	NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported to be associated with various kinds of immunological diseases including colitis. However, there are few drug candidates targeting inflammasomes for the treatment of colitis. In the present study, we aimed at examining the effect of 1-ethyl-5-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole, a synthetic small molecular compound also named Fc11a-2, for the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in mice via targeting NLRP3 inflammasome. Treatment with Fc11a-2 dose-dependently attenuated the loss of body weight and shortening of colon length induced by DSS. In addition, the disease activity index, histopathologic scores and myeloperoxidase activity were also significantly reduced by Fc11a-2 treatment. Moreover, protein and mRNA levels of DSS-induced proinflammatory cytokines in colon, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-17A and IFN-γ, were markedly suppressed by Fc11a-2. Furthermore, a decreased CD11c(+) macrophage infiltration in colons and inactivation of caspase-1 in peritoneal macrophages were detected in Fc11a-2-treated mice. The mechanism of action of Fc11a-2 was related to the inhibition of the cleavage of pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 which in turn suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability of Fc11a-2 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its potential use in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
23127600	Protective effect of cinnamon polyphenols against STZ-diabetic mice fed high-sugar, high-fat diet and its underlying mechanism.	This study was designed to investigate the potential effects of 14days' intragastrically given of cinnamon polyphenols (CPS) in treating diabetic mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (150mgkg(-1)) and fed high-sugar, high-fat diet. The diabetic mice model was successfully established through determining on fasting blood-glucose (FBG) test. As revealed by glucose oxidase (GOD) and radioimmunoassay (RIA), both dimethyldiguanide (DC, 0.6gkg(-1)d(-1)) and CPS (0.3, 0.6, 1.2gkg(-1)d(-1)) treatments significantly resulted in down-regulation of blood glucose and insulin levels in serum, while the levels of oxidative stress markers were markedly lowered through ELISA assay. Meanwhile, the pathological damage in islet with pancreatic beta cells was ameliorated by treatment of CPS at different doses, as shown in HE stain. At the same time, the treatments also caused notable reduction of iNOS, NF-κB expressions showing in Western blot analysis. These findings demonstrate that cinnamon polyphenols can exert the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects through the mechanisms that may be associated with repairing pancreatic beta cells in diabetic mice and improving its anti-oxidative capacity, as well as attenuating cytotoxicity via inhibition of iNOS, NF-κB activation.
16371234	Involvement of COX-1 and up-regulated prostaglandin E synthases in phosphatidylserine liposome-induced prostaglandin E2 production by microglia.	After engulfment of apoptotic cells through phosphatidylserine (PS)-mediated recognition, microglia secrete prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a potent anti-inflammatory molecule in the central nervous system. Despite the clinical significance, the mechanism underlying PGE2 production by phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is poorly understood. In the present study, we used PS liposomes to elucidate the phagocytic pathway for PGE2 production in microglia, because PS liposomes mimic the effects of apoptotic cells on microglia/macrophages. The level of PGE2 in the culture medium of primary cultured rat microglia was significantly increased by PS liposomes treatment but not by phosphatidylcholine liposomes treatment. The specific ligand for class B scavenger receptor (SR-B), high density lipoprotein, significantly suppressed PS liposome-induced PGE2 production. PS liposomes were immediately phagocytosed by microglia and sorted to endosomes/lysosomes. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and membrane-bound prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) were induced by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not with PS liposomes. On the other hand, mPGES-2 and cytosolic PGES (cPGES) that are functionally coupled with COX-1 were upregulated after treatment with PS liposomes or LPS. Furthermore, PS liposome-induced PGE2 production was significantly suppressed by indomethacin, a preferential COX-1 inhibitor, but not by NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. PS liposomes induced activation of p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in SR-BI independent manner. These observations strongly suggest that the up-regulation of terminal PGESs that are preferentially coupled with COX-1, especially mPGES-2, plays the pivotal role in PS liposome-induced PGE2 production by microglia. Although SR-BI plays an essential role in PS liposome-induced PGE2 production, other PS-recognizing receptors, possibly PS-specific receptor, could also promote PGE2 production by transducing intracellular signals including p44/p42 ERK after PS liposomes treatment.
23339678	Impact of ketorolac administration around ovarian stimulation on in vivo and in vitro fertilization and subsequent embryo development.	Abstract We performed this study to investigate the effect of ketorolac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) administration around ovarian stimulation on in vivo and in vitro fertilization process. Sixty-four female mice (ICR) were injected with ketorolac (0, 7.5, 15 and 30 µg/d) for 3 d starting from the day of eCG treatment. In experiment 1, 41 mice were triggered by hCG and then mated; two-cell embryos were obtained and in vitro development up to blastocyst was observed. In experiment 2, 23 mice were triggered by hCG and mature oocytes were collected; in vitro fertilization rate and subsequent embryo development up to blastocyst was recorded. In experiment 1, the blastocyst-forming rates per in vivo fertilized two-cell embryo showed an inverse relationship with a dosage of ketorolac (97.6%, 64.2%, 35.4% and 25.9%). In experiment 2, degenerated oocytes were frequently observed in a dose-dependent manner (4.3%, 22.9%, 22.4% and 75.0%). Lower fertilization rates were noted in all the three ketorolac-treating groups; blastocyst-forming rate was significantly lower in 30-µg-treating group when compared with the control group. Administration of ketorolac around ovarian stimulation significantly affects the development of in vivo fertilized embryo in a dose-dependent manner. High-dose ketorolac could result in a poor oocyte quality and decreased embryo developmental competence.
23354393	Bioactive microconstituents and antioxidant properties of wild edible mushrooms from the island of Lesvos, Greece.	Crude composition, fatty acids, sterols, total phenolic content (TPC), individual polyphenols and terpenic acids were determined in five wild edible mushrooms species (Lactarius deliciosus, Lactarius sanguifluus, Lactarius semisanguifluus, Russula delica, Suillus bellinii) from Lesvos Island, Greece. In addition, the DPPH scavenging capacity, the ferric ion reducing power (FRAP) and the ferrous ion chelating activity of mushroom methanolic extracts were assessed. Among sterols, ergosterol predominated at concentrations 9.2-18.0mg/100g fw. Total phenolic content of mushroom extracts ranged from 6.0 to 20.8mg GAE/100g fw. Up to 19 simple polyphenols were determined in mushrooms extracts, the more abundant being p-OH-benzoic acid, p-OH-phenylacetic acid, o-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and chrysin. In addition, the triterpenic acids oleanolic and ursolic were detected for the first time in mushrooms. All species exerted antioxidant activity and ferrous ion chelating capacity. Principal component analysis revealed good correlations between TPC, DPPH and FRAP but not with metal chelating activity. It seems that mushrooms polyphenols exert antiradical and reducing activities, but they are not strong metal chelators, the observed chelating ability being probably due to other classes of compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the bioactive microconstituents and antioxidant activity of wild Greek edible mushrooms.
20615127	Resistance to thyroid hormone due to a novel thyroid hormone receptor mutant in a patient with hypothyroidism secondary to lingual thyroid and functional characterization of the mutant receptor.	BACKGROUND: We describe a rare case of congenital hypothyroidism and an extremely high serum thyrotropin (TSH) level caused by a combination of resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) and a lingual thyroid. As the RTH mutant, R316C, was new, the optimum dose of levothyroxine was unclear. To aid in assessment of the therapy, we characterized the mutant R316C thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and compared it with a common mutant, R316H, using in vitro studies. SUMMARY: The patient was a newborn female having severe hypothyroidism with a free thyroxine level of 0.36 ng/dL and a serum TSH level of 177 microU/mL. A scintiscan showed ectopic lingual thyroid tissue without a normal thyroid gland. Supplementation with levothyroxine at a dose of >350 microg/day did not normalize the serum TSH level; however, the patient showed normal growth and intelligence at 14 years of age. Consistent with the results of a computer analysis, the binding of R316C to triiodothyronine (T3) was significantly decreased to 38% that of the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that like R316H, R316C did not form a homodimer, but formed a heterodimer with RXR. However, a glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay showed reduced binding of R316C with NCoR in the absence of T3 and impaired release in the presence of T3. In addition, transient transfection experiments demonstrated that unlike R316H, R316C had severe impairment of transcriptional activity on genes both positively and negatively regulated by thyroid hormone. It also had a clear dominant negative effect on genes negatively, but not positively, regulated by thyroid hormone, including the TSH-releasing hormone and TSHbeta genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of a R316C TR mutation. The characteristics of the R316C mutant differed from those of the R316H mutant. Our findings suggest that R316C causes reduced association with and impaired release of NCoR, resulting in RTH predominantly at the pituitary level, and that slightly elevated serum TSH level with high dose of levothyroxine might be optimum for normal growth.
10796631	Long acting beta-agonists versus theophylline for maintenance treatment of asthma.	BACKGROUND: Theophylline and long acting beta2-agonists are bronchodilators used for the management of persistent asthma symptoms, especially nocturnal asthma. They represent different classes of drug with differing side-effect profiles. OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative efficacy, safety and side-effects of long-acting beta-agonists and theophylline in the maintenance treatment of asthma. SEARCH STRATEGY: Randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group register. The register was searched using the following terms: asthma and theophylline and long acting beta-agonist or formoterol or foradile or eformoterol or salmeterol or bambuterol or bitolterol. Titles and abstracts were then screened to identify potentially relevant studies. The bibliography of each RCT was searched for additional RCTs. Authors of identified RCTs were contacted for other relevant published and unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: All included studies were RCTs involving adults and children with clinical evidence of asthma. These studies must have compared oral sustained release and/or dose adjusted theophylline with an inhaled long-acting beta-agonist. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Potentially relevant trials, identified by screening titles and/or abstracts, were obtained. Two reviewers independently assessed full text versions of these trials to decided whether the trial should be included in the review, and assessed its methodological quality. Where there was disagreement between reviewers, this was resolved by consensus, or reference to a third party. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by simple agreement. Study authors were contacted to clarify randomisation methods, provide missing data, verify the data extracted and identify unpublished studies. Relevant pharmaceutical manufacturers were also contacted. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials met the inclusion criteria. Five used salmeterol and one, biltoterol. They were of varying quality. There was a trend for salmeterol to improve FEV1 more than theophylline in three studies and salmeterol use was associated with more symptom free nights. Bitolterol, used in only one study, was reported to be less effective than theophylline. Subjects taking salmeterol experienced fewer adverse events than those using theophylline (Relative Risk 0.38; 95%Confidence Intervals 0.25, 0.57). Significant reductions were reported for central nervous system adverse events (Relative Risk 0.51; 95%Confidence Intervals 0.30, 0.88) and gastrointestinal adverse events (Relative Risk 0.32; 95%Confidence Intervals 0.17, 0.59). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Salmeterol may be more effective than theophylline in reducing asthma symptoms including night waking and improving lung function. More adverse events occurred in subjects using theophylline when compared to salmeterol.
17594192	Phenserine.	Phenserine, a derivative of physostigmine, was first described as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and was shown to improve cognition in various experimental paradigms in rodents and dogs. It was clinically tested for Alzheimer's disease, with moderate success in initial Phase II studies. Phenserine deserves attention for an additional quality of action: in addition to inhibiting AChE, it modulates the amount of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neuronal cell culture by reducing APP translation. This effect probably involves interaction of phenserine with a regulatory element in the 5'-untranslated region of the APP gene that controls APP expression. Phenserine apparently reduces translational efficiency of APP mRNA into protein, a process that may involve an interaction with iron and/or an iron-responsive element. As a consequence, phenserine reduces beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) formation in vitro and in vivo. Phenserine is also unique because of differing actions of its enantiomers: (-)-phenserine is the active enantiomer for inhibition of AChE, whereas (+)-phenserine ('posiphen') has weak activity as an AChE inhibitor and can be dosed much higher. Both enantiomers are equipotent in downregulating APP expression. (+)-Posiphen may be a promising drug, either alone or in combination with (-)-phenserine, to attenuate the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
23526644	Inhibition of Ebola Virus Infection: Identification of Niemann-Pick C1 as the Target by Optimization of a Chemical Probe.	A high throughput screen identified adamantane dipeptide 1 as an inhibitor of Ebola virus (EboV) infection. Hit-to-lead optimization to determine the structure-activity relationship (SAR) identified the more potent EboV inhibitor 2 and a photoaffinity labeling agent 3. These anti-viral compounds were employed to identify the target as Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a host protein that binds the EboV glycoprotein and is essential for infection. These studies establish NPC1 as a promising target for anti-viral therapy.
23290724	Zinc drives a tertiary fold in the prion protein with familial disease mutation sites at the interface.	The cellular prion protein PrP(C) consists of two domains--a flexible N-terminal domain, which participates in copper and zinc regulation, and a largely helical C-terminal domain that converts to β sheet in the course of prion disease. These two domains are thought to be fully independent and noninteracting. Compelling cellular and biophysical studies, however, suggest a higher order structure that is relevant to both PrP(C) function and misfolding in disease. Here, we identify a Zn²⁺-driven N-terminal to C-terminal tertiary interaction in PrP(C). The C-terminal surface participating in this interaction carries the majority of the point mutations that confer familial prion disease. Investigation of mutant PrPs finds a systematic relationship between the type of mutation and the apparent strength of this domain structure. The structural features identified here suggest mechanisms by which physiologic metal ions trigger PrP(C) trafficking and control prion disease.
17632107	Ligand-dependent transcriptional activities of four torafugu pufferfish Takifugu rubripes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.	Structural and functional properties were investigated for four peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), PPARalpha1, PPARalpha2, PPARbeta, and PPARgamma, from torafugu pufferfish Takifugu rubripes and determined for their transcriptional activity by the reporter assay using reporter plasmids containing three copies of the acyl-CoA oxidase PPAR response element. Although torafugu PPARs showed a high similarity in the primary structure to other vertebrate counterparts, torafugu PPARalpha2 and gamma contained additional sequences of 21 and 28 amino acids, respectively, as in the case of other teleost fish species when compared with African clawed frog counterparts. The transcriptional activity of torafugu PPARalpha1 was enhanced 4.5- and 11.5-fold by Wy-14643 and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) each at 10 microM, respectively, whereas that of PPARalpha2, 4.5- and 7.3-fold at the same concentration of the respective ligands, respectively. The activities of torafugu PPARalpha1 and alpha2 were also enhanced 5.6- and 6.3-fold by ETYA at 1 microM, respectively, but not by Wy-14643 at this concentration. Furthermore, the activities of the two torafugu PPARalphas were enhanced 4.3- and 7.6-fold by arachidonic acid, 4.4- and 5.2-fold by docosahexaenoic acid, and 6.7- and 8.0-fold by eicosapentaenoic acid each at 50 microM, respectively. On the other hand, the activities of torafugu PPARbeta and gamma were not changed by Wy-14643, ETYA, rosiglitazone, nor PUFAs. These results suggest that the activities of torafugu PPARbeta and gamma require undefined ligands. Alternatively, the molecular mechanisms involved in their activation are different from those of other vertebrates.
20012638	Effects of bambuterol and terbutaline on isolated rat's tracheal smooth muscle.	Terbutaline (Bricanyl) and its prodrug Bambuterol (Bambec) are highly potent beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists often used in asthma patients. Terbutaline in the form of inhaled short-acting bronchodilator relieves asthmatic symptoms. However, the effects of bambuterol given intratracheally have rarely been explored. To verify the effect of bambuterol and terbutaline, which act on the tracheal smooth muscle directly in vitro, we used our preparation to test the effects of bambuterol on isolated rat's tracheal smooth muscle compared with terbutaline. The following assessments of bambuterol and terbutaline were performed: (1) effect on tracheal smooth muscle resting tension; (2) effect on contraction caused by 10(-6) M methacholine as a parasympathetic mimetic; (3) effect of the drugs on electrically induced tracheal smooth muscle contractions. The results indicated that adding bambuterol induced a significant further contraction to 10(-6) M methacholine-induced contraction when the preparation was increased to 10(-4) M. But terbutaline elicited a relaxation response at a dose of 10(-6) M or more. Both bambuterol and terbutaline could inhibit electrical field stimulation (EFS) induced spike contraction. Terbutaline had an anti-cholinergic effect that could relieve asthmatic symptoms. But the effect of bambuterol acting on tracheal smooth muscle directly was controversial.
23500061	Anti-apoptotic cardioprotective effects of SHP-1 gene silencing against ischemia-reperfusion injury: Use of deoxycholic acid-modified low molecular weight polyethyleneimine as a cardiac siRNA-carrier.	The cardiomyocyte apoptosis plays a critical role in the development of myocardial injury after ischemia and reperfusion. Thus, alteration of the major apoptosis-regulatory factors during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion is expected to have favorable cardioprotective effects. Herein, we report ischemic-reperfused myocardial infarction (MI) repair with siRNA against Src homology region 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), which is known as a key factor involved in regulating the progress of apoptosis in many cell types. A low molecular weight polyethyleneimine modified with deoxycholic acid (PEI1.8-DA)-based delivery strategy was suggested for the cardiac application of SHP-1 siRNA to overcome the poor gene delivery efficiency to myocardium due to the highly charged structures of the compact cardiac muscles. The PEI1.8-DA conjugates formed stable nanocomplexes with SHP-1 siRNA via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes effectively silenced SHP-1 gene expression in cardiomyocytes, leading to a significant inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis under hypoxia. In comparison to conventional gene carriers, relatively large amounts of siRNA molecules remained after treatment with the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes. Cardiac administration of the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes resulted in substantial improvement in SHP-1 gene silencing, which can be explained by the enhancement of cardiac delivery efficiency of the PEI1.8-DA conjugates. In addition, in vivo treatment with the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplexes induced a highly significant reduction in myocardial apoptosis and infarct size in rat MI models. These results demonstrate that the PEI1.8-DA/SHP-1 siRNA polyplex formulation is a useful system for efficient gene delivery into the compact myocardium that provides a fundamental advantage in treating ischemic-reperfused MI.
20091113	Polymorphisms in dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) are associated with stimulant effects of D-amphetamine: an exploratory pharmacogenetic study using healthy volunteers.	Individuals vary in their subjective responses to stimulant drugs, and these differences are believed to be partially genetic in origin. We evaluated associations between mood, cognitive and cardiovascular responses to d-amphetamine and four polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3): rs460000, rs3756450, rs37022 and rs6869645. Healthy Caucasian male and female volunteers (N = 152) participated in a double-blind, crossover design study in which they received placebo, 10 and 20 mg of d-amphetamine. We measured self-reported rating of mood, performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Task, blood pressure and heart rate. Individuals with the C/C genotype at rs460000 (N = 83) reported approximately twofold higher ratings of stimulation and euphoria relative to the A/A+A/C (N = 69) genotype group, at both the 10 and 20 mg doses. No other responses or SNPs showed significant effects. rs460000 is in perfect LD with rs463379 (CEU: D' = 1; r (2) = 1), which was not studied here, but has been associated with etiology of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These findings suggest a pleiotropic effect of this polymorphic locus on both ADHD and sensitivity to the subjective effects of amphetamine.
22835278	Leydig cell hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumour in postmenopausal women: report of two cases.	Leydig cell hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumours of the ovary are rare. We present two cases in which patients had increased blood levels of testosterone and frank hirsutism. Imaging showed minimal abnormalities. After adrenal disease had been ruled out, they underwent a bilateral oophorectomy. One case showed a Leydig cell hyperplasia, the other a Leydig cell tumour. An androgen producing tumour should be excluded in every woman with evidence of hirsutism or frank virilization and markedly elevated testosterone levels. Adrenal disease with androgen hypersecretion can be suspected by detailed clinical, laboratory and radiologic imaging. Although DHEAS has a good sensitivity in the detection of adrenal origin of hyperandrogenism (and hence a good negative predictive value) it is not specific (specificity ranging from 85 to 98%). Imaging of the ovaries can be helpful but does not rule out ovarian disease if normal. Indeed, diffuse stromal Leydig cell hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumours (usually small) may escape imaging and in some cases diagnosis can only be made on pathology. As these clinical entities represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, oophorectomy should be considered in postmenopausal women with hirsutism and elevated testosterone levels, after the exclusion of adrenal causes. The procedure is relatively safe and effective. Follow-up remains indicated.
19244097	Studies of the biogenic amine transporters. 13. Identification of "agonist" and "antagonist" allosteric modulators of amphetamine-induced dopamine release.	Recent studies identified novel allosteric modulators of the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT). N-(Diphenylmethyl)-2-phenyl-4-quinazolinamine (SoRI-9804), N-(2,2-diphenylethyl)-2-phenyl-4-quinazolinamine (SoRI-20040), and N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-2-phenyl-4-quinazolinamine (SoRI-20041) partially inhibited [(125)I]3beta-(4'-iodophenyl)tropan-2beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester (RTI-55) binding, slowed the dissociation rate of [(125)I]RTI-55 from the DAT, and partially inhibited [(3)H]dopamine uptake. In the present study, we report that SoRI-9804 and SoRI-20040, at doses that do not alter release, partially inhibited d-amphetamine-induced DAT-mediated release of [(3)H]1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+))or[(3)H]dopamine from striatal synaptosomes ("DAT-mediated DA release") in a dose-dependent manner. SoRI-20041, which does not alter DAT-mediated DA release measured with [(3)H]DA, reversed the effect of SoRI-20040. SoRI-20040 and SoRI-9804 also partially inhibited DAT-mediated DA release induced by DA or (+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, demonstrating that the observed partial inhibition is not specific for a particular DAT substrate. SoRI-9804 and SoRI-20040 did not attenuate D-amphetamine-induced release of [(3)H]5-hydroxytryptamine from serotonergic, or [(3)H]MPP(+) from noradrenergic, nerve terminals. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that SoRI-9804, in contrast to cocaine, slowed D-amphetamine-induced release of [(3)H]MPP(+) from dopaminergic nerve terminals without altering the apparent rate constants. The two major findings of this study are 1) the identification of both "agonist" (SoRI-9804 and SoRI-20040) and "antagonist" (SoRI-20041) allosteric modulators of D-amphetamine-induced DAT-mediated DA release and 2) [(3)H]DA uptake and d-amphetamine-induced DAT-mediated efflux can be separately modulated. Such agents may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of stimulant addiction, Parkinson's disease, and other psychiatric disorders.
15494035	Amylin receptors: molecular composition and pharmacology.	Several receptors which bind the hormone AMY (amylin) with high affinity have now been identified. The minimum binding unit is composed of the CT (calcitonin) receptor at its core, plus a RAMP (receptor activity modifying protein). The receptors have been named AMY(1(a)), AMY(2(a)) and AMY(3(a)) in accordance with the association of the CT receptor (CT((a))) with RAMP1, RAMP2 and RAMP3 respectively. The challenge is now to determine the localization and pharmacological nature of each of these receptors. Recent attempts to achieve these aims will be briefly discussed.
11344206	Evidence for genetic heterogeneity of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1: identification of a novel mutation in the human mineralocorticoid receptor in one sporadic case and no mutations in two autosomal dominant kindreds.	Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by neonatal salt wasting resistant to mineralocorticoids. There are 2 forms of PHA1: the autosomal recessive form with symptoms persisting into adulthood, caused by mutations in the amiloride-sensitive luminal sodium channel, and the autosomal dominant or sporadic form, which shows milder symptoms that remit with age. Mutations in the gene encoding the human mineralocorticoid receptor (hMR) are, at least in some patients, responsible for the latter form of PHA1. We here report the results of a genetic study in a sporadic case and in 5 affected patients from 2 families with autosomal dominant PHA1. In the sporadic case we identified a new frameshift mutation, Ins2871C, in exon 9 of the hMR gene. Family members were asymptomatic and had no mutation. This mutation is the first described in exon 9 and impairs the last 27 amino acids of the hormone-binding domain. In 2 kindreds with autosomal dominant PHA1 we found no mutation of the hMR gene. Our results confirm the hypothesis that autosomal dominant or sporadic PHA1 is a genetically heterogeneous disease involving other, as yet unidentified, genes.
23500776	EROD activity induction in peripheral blood lymphocytes, liver and brain tissues of rats orally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.	Little is known in terms of multi-matrix cytochrome P450 activity induction under repeated oral exposure to planar halogenated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHH, PAH). In the present study, 60 rats were daily exposed, during 28days, to oral ingestion of a mixture consisting of phenanthrene, pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene at 0, 6 or 600μg/day. EROD activity, reflecting almost exclusively CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 activities, was measured in brain and liver microsomes as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). All induction kinetics could be appropriately fitted using logistic-like models. After 28days of exposure to a 6μg/day dose, EROD activity was found to be 91, 152 and 94-fold increased in lymphocytes, liver and brain, respectively, compared to day 0. Plateau activities could be appropriately fitted versus ingested doses using Hill or Michaelis-Menten models. Correlations between matrices made it possible to conclude that EROD activity in PBL should be considered as a sensitive, convenient and non-destructive approach for (i) evaluating EROD activity in liver, which was found to represent 98% of the observed EROD activities in the three tested matrices and (ii) evaluating oral exposure of homogeneous groups of farm animals (race, diet) to CYP inducing PAH and PHH.
12414329	Phosphodiesterase type 5 as a pharmacologic target in erectile dysfunction.	The scientific rationale of pharmacologically inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) is reviewed. Published literature on the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway for penile erection and on PDE5 inhibition using sildenafil as the model for pharmacologic PDE5 inhibition are assessed. The key second messenger in the mediation of penile erection is cGMP. PDE5 is the predominant PDE in the corpus cavernosum, and cGMP is its primary substrate. Therefore, in men with ED, elevation of cGMP in corpus cavernosal tissue via selective inhibition of cGMP-specific PDE5 is a means of improving erectile function at minimal risk of adverse events. This approach is validated by the clinical efficacy and safety of sildenafil, the pioneering drug for selective PDE5 inhibitor therapy for ED. Sildenafil exhibits inhibitory potency against PDE5 and a 10-fold lower dose-related inhibitory potency against rod outer segment PDE6, the predominant PDE in the phototransduction cascade in rods. Thus, its pharmacologic profile is predictable, with close correlation between pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Clinically, sildenafil improves erectile function in a large percentage of men with ED. The most common adverse events are due to PDE5 inhibition in vascular and visceral smooth muscle; similar adverse events are expected during therapeutic use of all PDE5 inhibitors. As free sildenafil plasma concentrations approach concentrations sufficient to inhibit retinal PDE6, usually at higher therapeutic doses, transient, reversible visual adverse events can occur, albeit infrequently. Selective inhibition of PDE5 is a rational therapeutic approach in ED, as proved by the clinical success of sildenafil.
23481236	Modulation of cellular insulin signaling and PTP1B effects by lipid metabolites in skeletal muscle cells.	Normal glucose regulation is achieved by having adequate insulin secretion and effective glucose uptake/disposal. Excess lipids in peripheral tissues - skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue - may attenuate insulin signaling through the protein kinase B (AKt) pathway and up-regulate protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative regulator of insulin signaling. We studied accumulation of lipid metabolites [triglycerides (TAGs), diglycerides (DAGs)] and ceramides in relation to insulin signaling and expression and phosphorylation of PTP1B by preincubating rat skeletal muscle cells (L6 myotubes) with three saturated and three unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) (200 μM). Cells were also evaluated in the presence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and thus AKt (0-100 nM). Unsaturated FFAs increased DAGs, TAGs and PTP1B expression significantly, but cells remained insulin sensitive as assessed by robust AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at serine (Ser) 50, Ser 398 and tyrosine 152. Saturated palmitic and stearic acids increased ceramides, up-regulated PTP1B, and had AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50 impaired. We show a significant correlation between phosphorylation levels of AKt and of PTP1B at Ser 50 (R(2)=0.84, P<.05). The same was observed with increasing wortmannin dose (R(2)=0.73, P<.05). Only FFAs that increased ceramides caused impairment of AKt and PTP1B phosphorylation at Ser 50. PTP1B overexpression in the presence of excess lipids may not directly cause insulin resistance unless it is accompanied by decreased PTP1B phosphorylation. A clear relationship between PTP1B phosphorylation levels at Ser 50 and its negative effect on insulin signaling is shown.
23477419	Design, Synthesis, and Pharmacological Characterization of Novel Endomorphin-1 Analogues as Extremely Potent μ-Opioid Agonists.	Recently we reported the synthesis and structure-activity study of endomorphin-1 (EM-1) analogues containing novel, unnatural α-methylene-β-aminopropanoic acids (Map). In the present study, we describe new EM-1 analogues containing Dmt(1), (R/S)-βPro(2), and (ph)Map(4)/(2-furyl)Map(4). All of the analogues showed a high affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and increased stability in mouse brain homogenates. Of the new compounds, Dmt(1)-(R)-βPro(2)-Trp(3)-(2-furyl)Map(4) (analogue 12) displayed the highest affinity toward MOR, in the picomolar range (Ki(μ) = 3.72 pM). Forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation assays indicated that this analogue displayed an extremely high agonistic potency, in the subpicomolar range (EC50 = 0.0421 pM, Emax = 99.5%). This compound also displayed stronger in vivo antinociceptive activity after iv administration when compared to morphine in the tail-flick test, which indicates that this analogue was able to cross the blood-brain barrier.
1730582	Mechanism of the irreversible inactivation of mouse ornithine decarboxylase by alpha-difluoromethylornithine. Characterization of sequences at the inhibitor and coenzyme binding sites.	Mouse ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant enzyme used for determination of the binding site for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and of the residues modified in the inactivation of the enzyme by the enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding lysine in mouse ODC was identified as lysine 69 of the mouse sequence by reduction of the purified holoenzyme form with NaB[3H]4 followed by digestion of the carboxymethylated protein with endoproteinase Lys-C, radioactive peptide mapping using reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and gas-phase peptide sequencing. This lysine is contained in the sequence PFYAVKC, which is found in all known ODCs from eukaryotes. The preceding amino acids do not conform to the consensus sequence of SXHK, which contains the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding lysine in a number of other decarboxylases including ODCs from E. coli. Using a similar procedure to analyze ODC labeled by reaction with [5-14C]DFMO, it was found that lysine 69 and cysteine 360 formed covalent adducts with the inhibitor. Cysteine 360, which was the major adduct accounting for about 90% of the total labeling, is contained within the sequence -WGPTCDGL(I)D-, which is present in all known eukaryote ODCs. These results provide strong evidence that these two peptides form essential parts of the catalytic site of ODC. Analysis by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides containing the DFMO-cysteine adduct indicated that the adduct formed in the enzyme was probably the cyclic imine S-(2-(1-pyrroline)methyl)cysteine. This is readily oxidized to S-((2-pyrrole)methyl)cysteine or converted to S-((2-pyrrolidine)methyl)cysteine by NaBH4 reduction. This adduct is consistent with spectral evidence showing that inactivation of the enzyme with DFMO does not entail the formation of a stable adduct between the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the enzyme, and the inhibitor.
7599160	The dynamics of cobalamin utilization in L-1210 mouse leukemia cells: a model of cellular cobalamin metabolism.	The uptake and metabolism of cobalamin (Cbl) has been studied in L-1210 murine leukemia cells propagating in vitro. Extracellular Cbl (protein bound and free) and intracellular Cbl (protein bound and free) were determined after culturing L-1210 cells in the presence of [57Co]cyanocobalamin (CN-Cbl) bound to transcobalamin II (transcobalamin, TC). The intracellular pool of free [57Co]Cbl increased during the first 24 h of culture and a substantial fraction of this free pool was effluxed from the cell to the medium. Upon depletion of extracellular TC-[57Co]CN-Cbl, the intracellular concentration of free Cbl decreased as did the efflux of Cbl to the medium. Internalized [57Co]CN-Cbl was converted to hydroxocobalamin (OH-Cbl), methylcobalamin (Me-Cbl) and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. These Cbl forms were found in both soluble (cytoplasmic) and insoluble (membrane) fractions. Intracellular protein-bound [57Co]Cbl fractionated with methionine synthase (MS) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MU) activity. The major form of Cbl associated with the two enzymes was OH-Cbl. Cells propagated in medium containing N5-methyltetrahydrofolate and homocysteine showed a substantial increase in MS activity which paralleled the increase in the intracellular concentration of Me-Cbl and the Cbl bound to the enzyme.
9204085	Pharmacology and chemistry of adapalene.	BACKGROUND: Retinoid research in the field of dermatology has been influenced by the clinical success of topical tretinoin and oral isotretinoin in the treatment of acne, and by the discovery of high-affinity binding proteins for retinoic acid mediating its action and interaction with other vitamins and hormones. OBJECTIVE: We sought molecules with an optimal balance between stability, efficacy, and local tolerance for topical acne therapy. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo bioassay systems were used to test the ability of retinoids to modulate cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, antiinflammatory properties were assessed. Binding and transactivation assays were used to compare affinities and transcriptional activities of adapalene and tretinoin for the nuclear transcription factors, retinoic acid receptors (RARs). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Adapalene is a stable naphthoic acid derivative with potent retinoid pharmacology, controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition it has significant antiinflammatory action. The nuclear gene transcription factors RAR beta and RAR gamma mediate the retinoid activity of adapalene.
9832994	Antagonism of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine-induced inhibition of exploratory activity in an emergence procedure, the open field test, in rats.	The effects of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) were studied on exploratory behaviour in the open field test, using a procedure designed to evaluate the emergence of rats into a novel environment. mCPP reduced the exploratory activity in a dose-related manner after subcutaneous (s.c.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intravenous (i.v.) administration. The inhibition was manifest in all the parameters used to quantify the exploration of the open field area. Additional neuroendocrine experiments in a parallel group of rats revealed a dose-related increase in plasma prolactin and ACTH levels after i.v. mCPP, pointing to a general state of arousal in these mCPP-treated animals. A number of 5-HT antagonists were tested for their ability to prevent or reverse the behavioural inhibition induced by an i.v. injection of 1.0 g/kg mCPP given 15 min before testing in the open field. The antagonists were injected s.c. or given orally at various time intervals before mCPP, or they were injected i.v. 10 min after mCPP. The lowest active doses for the attentuation of the mCPP-induced behavioural inhibition after s.c., oral and i.v. administration, respectively, were 0.04, 40 and 10 mg/kg for pizotifen; 0.16, 0.16 and 0.16 mg/kg for mianserin; 0.63, 0.16 and 0.16 mg/kg for methysergide, and 0.16, 2.5 and 2.5 mg/kg for ritanserin. The lowest active doses of mirtazapine after s.c. and i.v. treatment were 0.01 and 0.16 mg/kg. These data indicate that mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonists such as pizotifen and methysergide, and mixed 5-HT and catecholamine antagonists such as mianserin and mirtazapine are more potent antagonists of mCPP-induced behavioural inhibition in rats than the more selective 5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonist ritanserin.
17350061	Transplacental exposure to inorganic arsenic at a hepatocarcinogenic dose induces fetal gene expression changes in mice indicative of aberrant estrogen signaling and disrupted steroid metabolism.	Exposure to inorganic arsenic in utero in C3H mice produces hepatocellular carcinoma in male offspring when they reach adulthood. To help define the molecular events associated with the fetal onset of arsenic hepatocarcinogenesis, pregnant C3H mice were given drinking water containing 0 (control) or 85 ppm arsenic from day 8 to 18 of gestation. At the end of the arsenic exposure period, male fetal livers were removed and RNA isolated for microarray analysis using 22K oligo chips. Arsenic exposure in utero produced significant (p<0.001) alterations in expression of 187 genes, with approximately 25% of aberrantly expressed genes related to either estrogen signaling or steroid metabolism. Real-time RT-PCR on selected genes confirmed these changes. Various genes controlled by estrogen, including X-inactive-specific transcript, anterior gradient-2, trefoil factor-1, CRP-ductin, ghrelin, and small proline-rich protein-2A, were dramatically over-expressed. Estrogen-regulated genes including cytokeratin 1-19 and Cyp2a4 were over-expressed, although Cyp3a25 was suppressed. Several genes involved with steroid metabolism also showed remarkable expression changes, including increased expression of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-7 (HSD17beta7; involved in estradiol production) and decreased expression of HSD17beta5 (involved in testosterone production). The expression of key genes important in methionine metabolism, such as methionine adenosyltransferase-1a, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase and thioether S-methyltransferase, were suppressed. Thus, exposure of mouse fetus to inorganic arsenic during a critical period in development significantly alters the expression of various genes encoding estrogen signaling and steroid or methionine metabolism. These alterations could disrupt genetic programming at the very early life stage, which could impact tumor formation much later in adulthood.
23644213	Low molecular weight dual inhibitors of factor Xa and fibrinogen binding to GPIIb/IIIa with highly overlapped pharmacophores.	Dual antithrombotic agents acting as anticoagulants and aggregation inhibitors could have substantial advantages over currently prescribed combinations of antithrombotic drugs. Herein, we report compounds with moderate inhibitory activity for factor Xa and fibrinogen GPIIb/IIIa binding (both in the micromolar range). These compounds resulted from our efforts to merge the pharmacophores of selective factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban with a mimic of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence of fibrinogen to obtain designed multiple ligands with potential antithrombotic activity. Resulting from this study, a structurally novel class of submicromolar fibrinogen GPIIb/IIIa binding inhibitor bearing 1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one moiety is also described.
16248990	Nicotinic-receptor potentiator drugs, huprine X and galantamine, increase ACh release by blocking AChE activity but not acting on nicotinic receptors.	The main goal of the present study was to analyse the effects of (+/-)-huprine X ((+/-)-HX) and galantamine (GAL), with potentiating action on nicotinic receptors, and huperzine A (HPA), devoid of nicotinic activity, on [3H]-acetylcholine ([3H]-ACh) release in striatal slices of rat brain. All compounds are non-covalent and reversible inhibitors of AChE. Addition of (+/-)-HX (0.01 microM), GAL (10 microM) and HPA (0.1 microM) to the superfusion medium decreased the release of the ACh neurotransmitter to a similar extent: 36%, 30% and 34%, respectively (P<0.01). This effect was reverted in the presence of atropine (ATR; 0.1 microM), which blocks the pre-synaptic muscarinic M2 receptor. After that, a wide range of concentrations of drugs, concomitantly with ATR (0.1 microM), was studied in the presence of haloperidol (HAL; 0.01 microM), a dopamine D2 antagonist. In these conditions, a dose-dependent increase of [3H]-ACh release was observed in the presence of (+/-)-HX, GAL and HPA. To test the role of nicotinic receptors in the drugs' effects on [3H]-ACh release, mecamylamine (MEC) 100 microM was used to block such receptors. MEC alone significantly decreased neurotransmitter release by 18% (P<0.05), but no change was obtained in the presence of both ATR and MEC. Under these conditions, (+/-)-HX, GAL and HPA increased the release of [3H]-ACh by 37%, 25% and 38%, respectively (P<0.01). Taking into account all of these data, the present results suggest that the effects induced by (+/-)-HX and GAL nicotinic-receptor potentiators seem to be mainly due to their ability in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity, but not by interaction on the nicotinic receptors.
23294255	Development of new cyclic plasmin inhibitors with excellent potency and selectivity.	The trypsin-like serine protease plasmin is a target for the development of antifibrinolytic drugs for use in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass or organ transplantations to reduce excessive blood loss. The optimization of our recently described substrate-analogue plasmin inhibitors, which were cyclized between their P3 and P2 side chains, provided a new series with improved efficacy and excellent selectivity. The most potent inhibitor 8 binds to plasmin with an inhibition constant of 0.2 nM, whereas K(i) values >1 μM were determined for nearly all other tested trypsin-like serine proteases, with the exception of trypsin, which is also inhibited in the nanomolar range. Docking studies revealed a potential binding mode in the widely open active site of plasmin that explains the strong potency and selectivity profile of these inhibitors. The dialkylated piperazine-linker segment contributes to an excellent solubility of all analogues. Based on their overall profile the presented inhibitors are well suited for further development as injectable antifibrinolytic drugs.
23423972	Absorption, distribution, and biotransformation of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine in B6C3F1 mice (Mus musculus).	Absorption, distribution, and biotransformation are 3 critical aspects affecting toxicant action in animals. In the present study, B6C3F1 mice (Mus musculus) were exposed for 28 d to contaminated feed that contained 1 of 5 different hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) concentrations: 0 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg. The authors quantified RDX and its reductive transformation products hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine (MNX), hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine (DNX), and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitroso-1,3,5-triazine (TNX) in the stomach, intestine, plasma, liver, and brain of these mice. Average RDX concentrations followed a dose-dependent pattern for all matrices tested. No controls had concentrations above limits of detection. Average RDX concentrations in tissues of exposed mice ranged from 11.1 ng/mL to 182 ng/mL, 25.6 ng/g to 3319 ng/g, 123 ng/g to 233 ng/g, 144 ng/g to 35 900 ng/g, and 51.1 ng/g to 2697 ng/g in the plasma, brain, liver, stomach, and intestine, respectively. A considerable amount of RDX was present in the brain, especially in the highest-exposure group. This is consistent with the widely observed central nervous system effects caused by γ-aminobutyric acid inhibition associated with RDX exposure. N-nitroso metabolites of RDX were also present in tested tissues in a dose-dependent pattern. Average MNX concentrations in the stomachs of mice exposed to RDX ranged from nondetectable in control exposures to 490 ng/g in the highest-exposure groups. In the brain, MNX accumulated at a maximum average concentration of 165.1 ng/g, suggesting the potential formation of MNX from RDX within the brain. At higher exposures, DNX and TNX were present in the stomach, plasma, and brain of mice. The presence of RDX metabolites at notable amounts in different tissues suggests that RDX can transform into its N-nitroso metabolites in vivo by an undefined mechanism.

23493568	X-box binding protein 1 is essential for insulin regulation of pancreatic alpha cell function.	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) patients often exhibit hyperglucagonemia despite hyperglycemia suggesting defective α-cell function. While endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been suggested to underlie β-cell dysfunction in T2D, its role in α-cell biology remains unclear. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and its deficiency in β-cells has been reported to impair insulin secretion leading to glucose intolerance. To evaluate the role of XBP1 in α-cells, we created complementary in vivo (α-cell specific XBP1 knockout (αXBPKO) mice) and in vitro (stable XBP1 knock down α-cell line, αXBPKD) models. αXBPKO mice exhibited glucose intolerance, mild insulin resistance and an inability to suppress glucagon secretion following glucose stimulation. αXBPKD cells exhibited activation of IRE1, an upstream activator of XBP1, leading to phosphorylation of JNK. Interestingly, insulin treatment of αXBPKD cells reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (pY(896)), and phosphorylation of Akt, while enhancing serine phosphorylation (pS(307)) of IRS-1. Consequently the αXBPKD cells exhibited blunted suppression of glucagon secretion following insulin treatment in the presence of high glucose. Together, these data indicate that XBP1 deficiency in pancreatic α-cells induces altered insulin signaling and dysfunctional glucagon secretion.
23270805	Coming full circle: contributions of central and peripheral oxytocin actions to energy balance.	The neuropeptide oxytocin has emerged as an important anorexigen in the regulation of energy balance. Its effects on food intake have largely been attributed to limiting meal size through interactions in key regulatory brain regions such as the hypothalamus and hindbrain. Pharmacologic and pair-feeding studies indicate that its ability to reduce body mass extends beyond that of food intake, affecting multiple factors that determine energy balance such as energy expenditure, lipolysis, and glucose regulation. Systemic administration of oxytocin recapitulates many of its effects when administered centrally, raising the questions of whether and to what extent circulating oxytocin contributes to energy regulation. Its therapeutic potential to treat metabolic conditions remains to be determined, but data from diet-induced and genetically obese rodent models as well as application of oxytocin in humans in other areas of research have revealed promising results thus far.
12487427	Investigation of bradykinin metabolism in human and rat plasma in the presence of the dual ACE/NEP inhibitors GW660511X and omapatrilat.	Several studies have suggested that the accumulation of bradykinin, or that of one its metabolites BK1-8, is involved in the occurrence of side effects such as AE associated with the use of various ACEi. In this work a novel approach combining HPLC-UV on-line with oaTOF-MS and ICPMS was applied to investigate in human and rat plasma the metabolism of labelled BK (79/81 Br-Phe5) BrBK in the presence of two new dual ACE/NEP inhibitors (GW660511X and omapatrilat) currently under clinical trial. In human plasma the BrBK half-life values in the absence or in the presence of GW660511X (3.8 microM) or omapatrilat (32 nM) were 38.7 +/- 2.4, 51.2 +/- 4.7 and 114.7 +/- 9.3 min, respectively and BrBK was degraded into BrBK1-8, BrBK1-7, BrBK1-5 and Br-Phe. In the presence of inhibitors, however, the levels of these resultant metabolites were different. Unlike GW660511X, omapatrilat abolished the production of BrBK1-5 and BrBK1-7, suggesting a better ACE inhibition effect over GW660511X as no NEP activity was found. In addition the production of BrBK1-8 was enhanced in the presence of these inhibitors with a greater accumulation being observed with omapatrilat. The production of Br-Phe5 was reduced with GW660511X while no significant change was observed with omapatrilat after 4 h of incubation. In rat plasma the BrBK half-life values in the absence or in the presence of GW660511X (530 nM) or omapatrilat (50 nM) were 9.31 +/- 1.7, 22.06 +/- 3.1 and 25.3 +/- 1.7 min, respectively and BrBK was degraded into BrBK1-8, BrBK1-7, BrBK1-5 and Br-Phe5 plus BrBK2-9, BrBK4-8 and BrBK2-8 metabolites not found in human plasma. GW660511X and omapatrilat reduced the production of BrBK1-5 and BrBK1-7 with more effect being observed with omapatrilat. GW660511X and omapatrilat increased the production of both BrBK1-8 and Br-Phe5 but not that of BrBK4-8 and BrBK2-8. This study shows that the potency of GW660511X in comparison with omapatrilat is more than 100-fold lower in human, but less than 10-fold lower in rat plasma, suggesting that rat may not be a suitable in vivo model for the evaluation of ACE/NEP inhibition in relation to effects in humans.
23282066	Evaluation of animal models for intestinal first-pass metabolism of drug candidates to be metabolized by CYP3A enzymes via in vivo and in vitro oxidation of midazolam and triazolam.	Abstract 1. To search an appropriate evaluation methodology for the intestinal first-pass metabolism of new drug candidates, grapefruit juice (GFJ)- and vehicle (tap water)-pretreated mice or rats were orally administered midazolam (MDZ) or triazolam (TRZ), and blood levels of the parent compounds and their metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography/MS/MS. A significant effect of GFJ to elevate the blood levels was observed only for TRZ in mice. 2. In vitro experiments using mouse, rat and human intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions demonstrated that GFJ suppressed the intestinal microsomal oxidation of MDZ and especially TRZ. Substrate inhibition by MDZ caused reduction in 1'-hydroxylation but not 4-hydroxylation in both intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions. The kinetic profiles of MDZ oxidation and the substrate inhibition in mouse intestinal and hepatic microsomal fractions were very similar to those in human microsomes but were different from those in rat microsomes. Furthermore, MDZ caused mechanism-based inactivation of cytochrome P450 3A-dependent TRZ 1'-hydroxylation in mouse, rat and human intestinal microsomes with similar potencies. 3. These results are useful information in the analysis of data obtained in mouse and rat for the evaluation of first-pass effects of drug candidates to be metabolized by CYP3A enzymes.
23406956	Protective role of L-carnitine and vitamin E on the testis of atherosclerotic rats.	Atherosclerosis is a condition caused by lipid build-up and inflammation in the arteries, so hyperlipidemia is the major reason for atherosclerosis. Testis was found to be negatively affected by hyperlipidemia which leads to its impaired functions. Vitamin E and <sc>l</sc>-carnitine have well-known lipid-lowering and antioxidative activities. Triton WR 1339 is a non-ionic detergent, which induces severe hyperlipidemia by inhibition of lipoprotein lipase. The present study evaluates the protective role of vitamin E and <sc>l</sc>-carnitine on the testis in atherosclerosis and detects the most effective choice for protection against atherosclerosis; vitamin E, <sc>l</sc>-carnitine or a combination of both. A total of 80 albino male rats were divided into eight groups (10 rats for each group): control (G(1)), triton (G(2)), <sc>l</sc>-carnitine (G(3)), triton + <sc>l</sc>-carnitine (G(4)), vitamin E (G(5)), triton + vitamin E (G(6)), <sc>l</sc>-carnitine + vitamin E (G(7)) and triton + <sc>l</sc>-carnitine + vitamin E (G(8)). Data showed a significant increase in the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 β HSD), testicular catalase and malondialdehyde (MDA) in G(2) when compared with G(1), whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), serum testosterone, testicular 17 ketosteroid reductase (17 KSR), total thiol and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) data showed a significant decrease in G(2) when compared with G(1). Treatment with <sc>l</sc>-carnitine or/and vitamin E helps in improving the adverse effect of triton; also the histological changes confirm this finding. So the present study recommends all people to include <sc>l</sc>-carnitine and vitamin E in their diet to be protected against atherosclerosis.
23267767	Development of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α inhibitors: effect of ortho-carborane substituents on HIF transcriptional activity under hypoxia.	A series of substituted ortho-carboranylphenoxyacetanilides were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit hypoxia-induced HIF-1 transcriptional activity using a cell-based reporter assay in HeLa cells expressing the HRE-dependent firefly luciferase reporter construct (HRE-Luc) and constitutively expressing CMV-driven Renilla luciferase reporter, and their ability to inhibit cell growth (GI(50)) using the MTT assay. Among the compounds synthesized, 1g and 1l showed significant inhibition of hypoxia-induced HIF-1 transcriptional activity (IC(50): 1.9 ± 0.4 and 1.4 ± 0.2 μM, respectively). Both compounds suppressed HIF-1α accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. The porcine heart malate dehydrogenase (MDH) refolding assay revealed that compound 1l inhibited human Hsp60 chaperone activity (IC(50): 6.80 ± 0.25 μM) and this inhibition activity was higher than that of ETB (IC(50): 10.9 ± 0.63 μM).
10637238	Comparison of chemotherapy with chemohormonal therapy as first-line therapy for metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer: An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study.	PURPOSE: Although hormonal therapy represents standard therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive disease, many patients receive initial chemotherapy because of the location, bulk, or aggressiveness of their disease. It is uncertain whether simultaneous hormonal therapy provides additional benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial E3186 was initiated to explore this question. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1988 and December 1992, 231 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-unknown metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive either chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil inverted question markCAF) or chemohormonal therapy (CAF plus tamoxifen and Halotestin inverted question markfluoxymesterone; Pharmacia-Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI inverted question markCAFTH) as front-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Patients who experienced a complete response to induction therapy either received or did not receive maintenance cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, prednisone, and TH as a secondary randomization. RESULTS: The response rates (complete response and partial response) of patients who received CAF and CAFTH were similar (69.2% v 68.9%, respectively; P =.99). Time to treatment failure (TTF) was slightly longer for patients who received chemohormonal therapy compared with chemotherapy alone patients (13.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.087), and TTF was significantly longer in ER-positive compared with ER-negative patients (17.4 months v 10.3 months, respectively; P =.048). However, ER status had no effect on overall survival (30.0 months for CAF v 29.3 months for CAFTH). CONCLUSION: In patients with potentially hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer, chemohormonal therapy prolongs TTF for ER-positive patients without improving overall survival.
12167474	Toxic, halogenated cysteine S-conjugates and targeting of mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism.	Several haloalkenes are metabolized in part to nephrotoxic cysteine S-conjugates; for example, trichloroethylene and tetrafluoroethylene are converted to S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC) and S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine (TFEC), respectively. Although DCVC-induced toxicity has been investigated since the 1950s, the toxicity of TFEC and other haloalkene-derived cysteine S-conjugates has been studied more recently. Some segments of the US population are exposed to haloalkenes either through drinking water or in the workplace. Therefore, it is important to define the toxicological consequences of such exposures. Most halogenated cysteine S-conjugates are metabolized by cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyases to pyruvate, ammonia, and an alpha-chloroenethiolate (with DCVC) or an alpha-difluoroalkylthiolate (with TFEC) that may eliminate halide to give a thioacyl halide, which reacts with epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues in proteins. Nine mammalian pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-containing enzymes catalyze cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase reactions, including mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (mitAspAT), and mitochondrial branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT(m)). Most of the cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyases are syncatalytically inactivated. TFEC-induced toxicity is associated with covalent modification of several mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism. Interestingly, the alpha-ketoglutarate- and branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (KGDHC and BCDHC), but not the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), are susceptible to inactivation. mitAspAT and BCAT(m) may form metabolons with KGDHC and BCDHC, respectively, but no PLP enzyme is known to associate with PDHC. Consequently, we hypothesize that not only do these metabolons facilitate substrate channeling, but they also facilitate toxicant channeling, thereby promoting the inactivation of proximate mitochondrial enzymes and the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction.
16893531	The effects of norepinephrine transporter inactivation on locomotor activity in mice.	BACKGROUND: Acute administration of different classes of antidepressants can enhance or reduce spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel environment, but the effects of chronic antidepressant treatment on spontaneous locomotor activity in novel and familiar environments are less well characterized. Because norepinephrine is an important regulator of spontaneous locomotor activity, we speculated that norepinephrine transporter blockade contributes to the effects of some antidepressants on spontaneous locomotor activity. METHODS: Antidepressant drugs (reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, venlafaxine, bupropion) were administered acutely (intraperitoneal) or chronically (via osmotic minipump) to control and norepinephrine transporter knockout mice, and spontaneous locomotor activity in novel or familiar environments was recorded. RESULTS: Acute treatment with most norepinephrine transporter-blocking antidepressants decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel environment, whereas chronic treatment decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in both novel and familiar environments. The exception was bupropion, a dual norepinephrine transporter/dopamine transporter blocker, which tended to increase spontaneous locomotor activity. Coadministration of reboxetine and the dopamine transporter blocker GBR 12909 also increased spontaneous locomotor activity. Norepinephrine transporter knockout mice had low basal spontaneous locomotor activity, which was increased by bupropion, whereas reboxetine had no effect in norepinephrine transporter knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Acute or chronic inactivation of the norepinephrine transporter decreases spontaneous locomotor activity in novel and familiar environments unless coupled with dopamine transporter blockade.
16854582	Effect of keratinocyte growth factor on cell viability in primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells.	In normal prostate, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), also known as fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7) serves as a paracrine growth factor synthesized in stromal cells that acts on epithelial cells through its receptor, KGFR. KGF and KGFR were found in human cancer epithelial cells as well as stromal cells. Since KGF expressed in epithelial cells of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in prostate cancer, it has been suggested that KGF might act as an autocrine factor in BPH and prostate cancer. To investigate the roles of KGF in cancerous stroma, primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells (PCSCs) were isolated and evaluated. These PCSCs possessed estrogen receptors and KGFR, but not androgen receptor as determined by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. KGF exhibited mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects that correlated with induction of cyclin-D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and phospho-Akt expression in PCSCs, where treatment with KGF antiserum abolished cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic protein expression. PCSCs exposed to KGF for various time periods resulted in phosphorylation of Akt and subsequent up-regulation of Bcl-2. KGF modulated dynamic protein expression indicated that KGF triggered cell cycle machinery and then activated anti-apoptotic actions in PCSCs. Cell proliferation analysis indicated that tamoxifen or ICI 182,780 reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner; however, KGF prevented this inhibition, which further demonstrated KGF triggered anti-apoptotic machinery through activating Bcl-2 and phospho-Akt expression. In summary, KGF has an autocrine effect and serves as a survival factor in primary cultured human prostate cancer stromal cells.
17643344	Combination chemotherapy with a substance P receptor antagonist (aprepitant) and melarsoprol in a mouse model of human African trypanosomiasis.	Drug therapy for late-stage (encephalitic) human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is currently very unsatisfactory with the most commonly used drug, melarsoprol, having a 5% overall mortality. There is evidence in a mouse model of HAT that Substance P (SP) receptor antagonism reduces the neuroinflammatory reaction to CNS trypanosome infection. In this study we investigated the effects of combination chemotherapy with melarsoprol and a humanised SP receptor antagonist aprepitant (EMEND) in this mouse model. The melarsoprol/aprepitant drug combination did not produce any clinical signs of illness in mice with CNS trypanosome infection. This lack of any additional or unexpected CNS toxicity in the mouse model of CNS HAT provides valuable safety data for the future possible use of this drug combination in patients with late-stage HAT.
9990013	Cooperative binding of ATP and MgADP in the sulfonylurea receptor is modulated by glibenclamide.	The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in pancreatic beta cells are critical in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Although electrophysiological studies provide clues to the complex control of KATP channels by ATP, MgADP, and pharmacological agents, the molecular mechanism of KATP-channel regulation remains unclear. The KATP channel is a heterooligomeric complex of SUR1 subunits of the ATP-binding-cassette superfamily with two nucleotide-binding folds (NBF1 and NBF2) and the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits. Here, we report that MgATP and MgADP, but not the Mg salt of gamma-thio-ATP, stabilize the binding of prebound 8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP to SUR1. Mutation in the Walker A and B motifs of NBF2 of SUR1 abolished this stabilizing effect of MgADP. These results suggest that SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly at NBF1 and that MgADP, either by direct binding to NBF2 or by hydrolysis of bound MgATP at NBF2, stabilizes prebound 8-azido-ATP binding at NBF1. The sulfonylurea glibenclamide caused release of prebound 8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP from SUR1 in the presence of MgADP or MgATP in a concentration-dependent manner. This direct biochemical evidence of cooperative interaction in nucleotide binding of the two NBFs of SUR1 suggests that glibenclamide both blocks this cooperative binding of ATP and MgADP and, in cooperation with the MgADP bound at NBF2, causes ATP to be released from NBF1.
23439561	NADPH Oxidase NOX5-S and Nuclear Factor κB1 Mediate Acid-Induced Microsomal Prostaglandin E Synthase-1 Expression in Barrett's Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Cells.	The mechanisms of progression from Barrett's esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) are not known. Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to be important in esophageal tumorigenesis. We have shown that COX-2 mediates acid-induced PGE2 production. The prostaglandin E synthase (PGES) responsible for acid-induced PGE2 production in BE, however, is not known. We found that microsomal PGES1 (mPGES1), mPGES2, and cytosolic PGES (cPGES) were present in FLO EA cells. Pulsed acid treatment significantly increased mPGES1 mRNA and protein levels but had little or no effect on mPGES2 or cPGES mRNA. Knockdown of mPGES1 by mPGES1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked acid-induced increase in PGE2 production and thymidine incorporation. Knockdown of NADPH oxidase, NOX5-S, a variant lacking calcium-binding domains, by NOX5 siRNA significantly inhibited acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, thymidine incorporation, and PGE2 production. Overexpression of NOX5-S significantly increased the luciferase activity in FLO cells transfected with a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in vivo activation reporter plasmid pNF-κB-Luc. Knockdown of NF-κB1 p50 by p50 siRNA significantly decreased acid-induced increase in mPGES1 expression, thymidine incorporation, and PGE2 production. Two novel NF-κB binding elements, GGAGTCTCCC and CGGGACACCC, were identified in the mPGES1 gene promoter. We conclude that mPGES1 mediates acid-induced increase in PGE2 production and cell proliferation. Acid-induced mPGES1 expression depends on activation of NOX5-S and NF-κB1 p50. Microsomal PGES1 may be a potential target to prevent or treat EA.
22968082	Influence of stimulant-induced hyperactivity on social approach in the BTBR mouse model of autism.	Translational research is needed to discover pharmacological targets and treatments for the diagnostic behavioral domains of autism spectrum disorders. Animal models with phenotypic relevance to diagnostic criteria offer clear experimental strategies to test the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. Antagonists of mGluR5 receptors are in clinical trials for Fragile X syndrome and under investigation for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. However, in preclinical studies of mGluR5 compounds tested in our laboratory and others, increased locomotion following mGluR5 modulation has been observed. Understanding the influence of general activity on sociability and repetitive behaviors will increase the accuracy of interpretations of positive outcomes measured from pharmacological treatment that produces locomotor activating or sedating effects. In the present studies, dose-response curves for d-amphetamine (AMPH)-induced hyperlocomotion were similar in standard B6 mice and in the BTBR mouse model of autism. AMPH produced significant, robust reductions in the high level of repetitive self-grooming that characterizes BTBR, and also reduced the low baseline grooming in B6, indicating that AMPH-induced hyperlocomotion competes with time spent engaged in self-grooming. We then tested AMPH in B6 and BTBR on the 3-chambered social approach task. One component of sociability, the time spent in the chamber with the novel mouse, in B6 mice was reduced, while the sniffing time component of sociability in BTBR mice was enhanced. This finding replicated across multiple cohorts treated with AMPH and saline vehicle. In-depth analysis revealed that AMPH increased the number and decreased the duration of sniffing bouts in BTBR, suggesting BTBR treated with AMPH mostly engaged in brief sniffs rather than true social interactions with the novel mouse during the social approach task. Our data suggest that compounds with stimulant properties may have some direct benefits on reducing repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders, particularly in the subset of autistic individuals with hyperactivity. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders'.
23349489	β-Cells Are Not Generated in Pancreatic Duct Ligation-Induced Injury in Adult Mice.	The existence of adult β-cell progenitors remains the most controversial developmental biology topic in diabetes research. It has been reported that β-cell progenitors can be activated by ductal ligation-induced injury of adult mouse pancreas and apparently act in a cell-autonomous manner to double the functional β-cell mass within a week by differentiation and proliferation. Here, we demonstrate that pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) does not activate progenitors to contribute to β-cell mass expansion. Rather, PDL stimulates massive pancreatic injury, which alters pancreatic composition and thus complicates accurate measurement of β-cell content via traditional morphometry methodologies that superficially sample the pancreas. To overcome this potential bias, we quantified β-cells from the entire pancreas and observed that β-cell mass and insulin content are totally unchanged by PDL-induced injury. Lineage-tracing studies using sequential administration of thymidine analogs, rat insulin 2 promoter-driven cre-lox, and low-frequency ubiquitous cre-lox reveal that PDL does not convert progenitors to the β-cell lineage. Thus, we conclude that β-cells are not generated in injured adult mouse pancreas.
23358307	Synthesis, DNA binding and antitumor evaluation of styelsamine and cystodytin analogues.	A series of N-14 sidechain substituted analogues of styelsamine (pyrido[4,3,2-mn]acridine) and cystodytin (pyrido[4,3,2-mn]acridin-4-one) alkaloids have been prepared and evaluated for their DNA binding affinity and antiproliferative activity towards a panel of human tumor cell lines. Overall it was found that styelsamine analogues were stronger DNA binders, with the natural products styelsamines B and D having particularly high affinity (K(app) 5.33 × 10(6) and 3.64 × 10(6) M(-1), respectively). In comparison, the cystodytin iminoquinone alkaloids showed lower affinity for DNA, but were typically just as active as styelsamine analogues at inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells in vitro. Sub-panel selectivity towards non-small cell lung, melanoma and renal cancer cell lines were observed for a number of the analogues. Correlation was observed between whole cell activity and clogP, with the most potent antiproliferative activity being observed for 3-phenylpropanamide analogues 37 and 41 (NCI panel average GI(50) 0.4 μM and 0.32 μM, respectively) with clogP ~4.0-4.5.
17040106	Reductive detoxification of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens by human NADH cytochrome b5 reductase and cytochrome b5.	Heterocyclic and aromatic amine carcinogens are thought to lead to tumor initiation via the formation of DNA adducts, and bioactivation to arylhydroxylamine metabolites is necessary for reactivity with DNA. Carcinogenic arylhydroxylamine metabolites are cleared by a microsomal, NADH-dependent, oxygen-insensitive reduction pathway in humans, which may be a source of interindividual variability in response to aromatic amine carcinogens. The purpose of this study was to characterize the identity of this reduction pathway in human liver. On the basis of our findings with structurally similar arylhydroxylamine metabolites of therapeutic drugs, we hypothesized that the reductive detoxification of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens was catalyzed by NADH cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R) and cytochrome b5 (cyt b5). We found that reduction of the carcinogenic hydroxylamines of the aromatic amine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP; found in cigarette smoke) and the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP; found in grilled meats) was indeed catalyzed by a purified system containing only human b5R and cyt b5. Specific activities were 56-346-fold higher in the purified system as compared to human liver microsomes (HLM), with similar Michaelis-Menten constants (K(m) values) in both systems. The stoichiometry for b5R and cyt b5 that yielded the highest activity in the purified system was also similar to that found in native HLM ( approximately 1:8 to 1:10). Polyclonal antisera to either b5R or cyt b5 significantly inhibited N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl (NHOH-4-ABP) reduction by 95 and 89%, respectively, and immunoreactive cyt b5 protein content in individual HLM was significantly correlated with individual reduction of both NHOH-4-ABP and N-hydroxy-PhIP (NHOH-PhIP). Finally, titration of HLM into the purified b5R/cyt b5 system did not enhance the efficiency of reduction activity. We conclude that b5R and cyt b5 are together solely capable of the reduction of arylhydroxylamine carcinogens, and we further hypothesize that this pathway may be a source of individual variability with respect to cancer susceptibility following 4-ABP or PhIP exposure.
23274058	Jaceosidin, isolated from dietary mugwort (Artemisia princeps), induces G2/M cell cycle arrest by inactivating cdc25C-cdc2 via ATM-Chk1/2 activation.	Jaceosidin, a flavonoid derived from Artemisia princeps (Japanese mugwort), has been shown to inhibit the growth of several human cancer cells, However, the exact mechanism for the cytotoxic effect of jaceosidin is not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the antiproliferative effect of jaceosidin in human endometrial cancer cells. We demonstrated that jaceosidin is a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than cisplatin in human endometrial cancer cells. In contrast, jaceosidin-induced cytotoxicity in normal endometrial cells was lower than that observed for cisplatin. Jaceosidin induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and modulated the levels of cyclin B and p-Cdc2 in Hec1A cells. Knockdown of p21 using specific siRNAs partially abrogated jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition. Additional mechanistic studies revealed that jaceosidin treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of Cdc25C and ATM-Chk1/2. Ku55933, an ATM inhibitor, reversed jaceosidin-induced cell growth inhibition, in part. Moreover, jaceosidin treatment resulted in phosphorylation of ERK, and pretreatment with the ERK inhibitor, PD98059, attenuated cell growth inhibition by jaceosidin. These data suggest that jaceosidin, isolated from Japanese mugwort, modulates the ERK/ATM/Chk1/2 pathway, leading to inactivation of the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex, followed by G2/M cell cycle arrest in endometrial cancer cells.
22709946	Enhanced mGlu5-receptor dependent long-term depression at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse of congenitally learned helpless rats.	Alterations of the glutamatergic system have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of major depression. In order to investigate the expression and function of mGlu5 receptors in an animal model for treatment-resistant depression we used rats bred for congenital learned helplessness (cLH) and the control strain, bred for resistance against inescapable stress, congenitally. not learned helpless rats (cNLH). Western blot analysis showed an increased expression of mGlu5 (but not mGlu1a) receptors in the hippocampus of cLH rats, as compared with control cNLH rats. We also examined mGlu1/5 receptor signaling by in vivo measurement of DHPG-stimulated polyphosphoinositides hydrolysis. Stimulation of (3)H-inositolmonophosphate formation induced by i.c.v. injection of DHPG was enhanced by about 50% in the hippocampus of cLH rats. Correspondingly, DHPG-induced long-term depression (LTD) at Schaffer collateral/CA1 pyramidal cell synapses was amplified in hippocampal slices of cLH rats, whereas LTD induced by low frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals did not change. Moreover, these effects were associated with decreased basal dendritic spine density of CA1 pyramidal cell in cLH rats. These data raise the attractive possibility that changes in the expression and function of mGlu5 receptors in the hippocampus might underlie the changes in synaptic plasticity associated with the depressive-like phenotype of cLH rats. However, chronic treatment of cLH rats with MPEP did not reverse learned helplessness, indicating that the enhanced mGlu5 receptor function is not the only player in the behavioral phenotype of this genetic model of depression. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors'.
12827214	Pharmacological characterization of unique prazosin-binding sites in human kidney.	In human kidney, we found unique prazosin-binding sites that were insensitive to phentolamine and were thus unlikely to be alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. As the binding of [(3)H]prazosin to phentolamine-insensitive sites was prevented by 100 microM guanabenz, the insensitive sites were evaluated by subtracting [(3)H]prazosin binding in the presence of 100 microM guanabenz from that in the presence of 10 microM phentolamine. [(3)H]Prazosin bound to the phentolamine-insensitive sites monophasically with a high affinity (pK(d); 9.1+/-0.08, n=8), and the B(max) value (814+/-204 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=8) was more than ten times that of the phentolamine-sensitive alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (pK(d)=9.9+/-0.13, B(max)=66+/-23 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=7). The phentolamine-insensitive sites in human kidney were highly sensitive to other quinazoline derivatives such as terazosin and doxazosin. However, other alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists (tamsulosin, WB4101 and corynanthine) did not inhibit the binding at a range of concentrations that generally exhibit alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism, and noradrenaline, rauwolscine and propranolol were without effect on the [(3)H]prazosin binding. On the other hand, ligands for the renal Na(+)-transporter (amiloride and triamterene) and for imidazoline recognition sites (guanabenz, guanfacine and agmatine) displaced the binding of [(3)H]prazosin to phentolamine-insensitive sites at micromolar concentrations. Photoaffinity labeling with [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin showed phentolamine-insensitive labeling at around 100 kDa, a molecular size larger than that of human alpha(1a)- and alpha(1b)-adrenoceptors expressed in 293 cells (50-60 and 70-80 kDa, respectively) on electrophoresis. In contrast, there was no detectable phentolamine-insensitive binding site but were phentolamine-sensitive alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in human liver (pK(d)=10.0+/-0.06, B(max)=44+/-6 fmol mg(-1) protein, n=3). Phentolamine-insensitive prazosin binding sites were also detected in rabbit kidney (approximately 50% of specific binding sites) but were minor in rat kidney (less than 20%). In conclusion, there are unique prazosin-binding sites in human kidney, the pharmacological profiles of which were distinct from those of known adrenoceptors.
23583257	Quinone compounds regulate the level of ROS production by the NADPH oxidase Nox4.	NADPH oxidase Nox4 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and plays a role in cellular signaling by providing reactive oxygen species (ROS) as intracellular messengers. Nox4 oxidase activity is thought to be constitutive and regulated at the transcriptional level; however, we challenge this point of view and suggest that specific quinone derivatives could modulate this activity. In fact, we demonstrated a significant stimulation of Nox4 activity by 4 quinone derivatives (AA-861, tBuBHQ, tBuBQ, and duroquinone) observed in 3 different cellular models, HEK293E, T-REx™, and chondrocyte cell lines. Our results indicate that the effect is specific toward Nox4 versus Nox2. Furthermore, we showed that NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) may participate in this stimulation. Interestingly, Nox4 activity is also stimulated by reducing agents that possibly act by reducing the disulfide bridge (Cys226, Cys270) located in the extracellular E-loop of Nox4. Such model of Nox4 activity regulation could provide new insight into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the electron transfer through the enzyme, i.e., its potential redox regulation, and could also define new therapeutic targets in diseases in which quinones and Nox4 are implicated.
21606412	Activity of XL184 (Cabozantinib), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with medullary thyroid cancer.	PURPOSE: XL184 (cabozantinib) is a potent inhibitor of MET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and RET, with robust antiangiogenic, antitumor, and anti-invasive effects in preclinical models. Early observations of clinical benefit in a phase I study of cabozantinib, which included patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), led to expansion of an MTC-enriched cohort, which is the focus of this article. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study of oral cabozantinib was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors. Primary end points included evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) determination. Additional end points included RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) response, pharmacodynamics, RET mutational status, and biomarker analyses. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled, including 37 with MTC. The MTD was 175 mg daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), mucositis, and AST, ALT, and lipase elevations and grade 2 mucositis that resulted in dose interruption and reduction. Ten (29%) of 35 patients with MTC with measurable disease had a confirmed partial response. Overall, 18 patients experienced tumor shrinkage of 30% or more, including 17 (49%) of 35 patients with MTC with measurable disease. Additionally, 15 (41%) of 37 patients with MTC had stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months, resulting in SD for 6 months or longer or confirmed partial response in 68% of patients with MTC. CONCLUSION: Cabozantinib has an acceptable safety profile and is active in MTC. Cabozantinib may provide clinical benefit by simultaneously targeting multiple pathways of importance in MTC, including MET, VEGFR2, and RET. A global phase III pivotal study in MTC is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00215605).
1375507	Prostacyclin analogues inhibit tissue factor expression in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 via a cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism.	Increased expression of tissue factor procoagulant by peripheral blood monocytes has been implicated in a number of thrombotic disorders. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether stable analogues of prostacyclin, a potent endothelium-derived platelet inhibitor and vasodilator, could inhibit tissue factor expression by human monocytic cells. Exposure of monocytic tumor THP-1 cells to 100 ng/ml endotoxin, 2 units/ml interleukin-1 beta, or 5 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-alpha for 4 hours led to increased tissue factor procoagulant activity. Preincubation for 30 minutes with iloprost, ciprostene, and carbacyclin led to a dose-dependent inhibition of tissue factor expression induced by all three challenging agents. Iloprost was the most potent: 50% inhibition occurred at 5 nM, a concentration close to the reported dissociation constant for iloprost binding to the platelet prostacyclin receptor. An orally active analogue, cicaprost, was equally effective against endotoxin-induced tissue factor expression. Carbacyclin and ciprostene were 100 times less potent. Iloprost prevented the endotoxin-induced expression of tissue factor antigen on the surface of THP-1 cells, as determined by flow cytometry. Iloprost (500 pM-50 nM) increased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP. This effect was potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. The inhibitory effects of iloprost on tissue factor expression were also potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine and mimicked by forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP but not dibutyryl cyclic GMP. These results suggest that prostacyclin may play a role in downregulating tissue factor expression in monocytes, at least in part via elevation of intracellular levels of cyclic AMP.
23479193	Synthesis and in-silico studies of some diaryltriazole derivatives as potential cyclooxygenase inhibitors.	The synthesis of several 4-phenyl-5-pyridin-4-yl-2,3-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones possessing N-2 Mannich bases or S-alkyl substituents, is reported. Several of them exhibited a low nanomolar COX enzyme inhibition activity. Most of the compounds showed inhibition of edema was similar to that evoked by celocoxib in animal model. Molecular docking studies of the compounds into the binding sites of COX-1 and COX-2 allowed us to shed light on the binding mode of these novel COX inhibitors.
11585753	The tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 ("Iressa") inhibits HER2-driven signaling and suppresses the growth of HER2-overexpressing tumor cells.	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly overexpressed in many human tumors and provides a new target for anticancer drug development. ZD1839 ("Iressa"), a quinazoline tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for the EGFR, has shown good activity in preclinical studies and in the early phase of clinical trials. However, because it remains unclear which tumor types are the best targets for treatment with this agent, the molecular characteristics that correlate with tumor sensitivity to ZD1839 have been studied. In a panel of human breast cancer and other epithelial tumor cell lines, HER2-overexpressing tumors were particularly sensitive to ZD1839. Growth inhibition of these tumor cell lines was associated with the dephosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, and HER3, accompanied by the loss of association of HER3 with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and down-regulation of Akt activity. These studies suggest that HER2-overexpressing tumors are particularly susceptible to the inhibition of HER family tyrosine kinase signaling and suggest novel strategies to treat these particularly aggressive tumors.
3994963	Drug-protein interactions: isolation and characterization of covalent adducts of phenoxybenzamine and calmodulin.	Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist containing a (chloroethyl)amine group, labels calmodulin in the presence of calcium. The covalent interaction is inhibited by chlorpromazine in a concentration-dependent manner. Adducts of calmodulin and phenoxybenzamine were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography into four major fractions: two containing 0.6 and 1.2 mol of drug per mol of protein and two different fractions each containing 2.0 mol/mol. Each adduct had a reduced ability to activate cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and myosin light chain kinase, and the chlorpromazine binding capacities of the phenoxybenzamine-calmodulin adducts were diminished to the extent of phenoxybenzamine incorporation into each adduct. Isolation and characterization of labeled peptides from phenoxybenzamine-modified calmodulins indicated that peptides encompassing residues 38-75, 107-126, and 127-148 contained phenoxybenzamine label. These studies directly demonstrate the relatedness between the binding activities of two structurally dissimilar calmodulin antagonists, demonstrate that covalent adducts of calmodulin and drugs with equal stoichiometries of labeling can have quantitative differences in activity and sites of modification, and provide direct evidence of distinct drug binding regions in calmodulin located in the amphipathic alpha-helical regions of the second and fourth domains.
17311416	Pre-steady-state currents in neutral amino acid transporters induced by photolysis of a new caged alanine derivative.	Na+-Dependent transmembrane transport of small neutral amino acids, such as glutamine and alanine, is mediated, among others, by the neutral amino acid transporters of the solute carrier 1 [SLC1, alanine serine cysteine transporter 1 (ASCT1), and ASCT2] and SLC38 families [sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1 (SNAT1), SNAT2, and SNAT4]. Many mechanistic aspects of amino acid transport by these systems are not well-understood. Here, we describe a new photolabile alanine derivative based on protection of alanine with the 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl (MNI) caging group, which we use for pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of alanine transport by ASCT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2. MNI-alanine has favorable photochemical properties and is stable in aqueous solution. It is also inert with respect to the transport systems studied. Photolytic release of free alanine results in the generation of significant transient current components in HEK293 cells expressing the ASCT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2 proteins. In ASCT2, these currents show biphasic decay with time constants, tau, in the 1-30 ms time range. They are fully inhibited in the absence of extracellular Na+, demonstrating that Na+ binding to the transporter is necessary for induction of the alanine-mediated current. For SNAT1, these transient currents differ in their time course (tau = 1.6 ms) from previously described pre-steady-state currents generated by applying steps in the membrane potential (tau approximately 4-5 ms), indicating that they are associated with a fast, previously undetected, electrogenic partial reaction in the SNAT1 transport cycle. The implications of these results for the mechanisms of transmembrane transport of alanine are discussed. The new caged alanine derivative will provide a useful tool for future, more detailed studies of neutral amino acid transport.
18439678	Porcine TLR8 and TLR7 are both activated by a selective TLR7 ligand, imiquimod.	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of highly conserved germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRR), which are utilized by the innate immune system to recognize microbial components, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP). We cloned and characterized porcine TLR7 and TLR8 genes from pig lymph node tissue. Sequence analysis showed that the aa sequence identities of porcine TLR7 with human, mouse and bovine TLR7 are 85, 78 and 90%, respectively, whereas porcine TLR8 aa sequence identities with human, mouse and bovine TLR8 are 73, 69 and 79%, respectively. Both porcine TLR7 and TLR8 proteins were expressed in cell lines and were N-glycosylated. The stimulatory activity of TLR7 and TLR8 ligands to porcine and human TLR7 and TLR8 in transiently transfected Cos-7 and 293T cells were analyzed using a NF-kappaB reporter assay. Two imidazoquinoline molecules, imiquimod and gardiquimod, markedly activated both porcine TLR7 and TLR8 whereas only human TLR7, but not TLR8, was activated by the ligands. Therefore, receptor specificity for porcine TLR8 is clearly species specific. We further showed that porcine TLR7 and TLR8 are located intracellularly and are mainly within the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, activation of transfected cells and porcine PBMC by TLR7 ligands was inhibited by bafilomycin A(1) indicating the requirement of endosomal/lysosomal acidification for activation of the receptors.
7837275	Conformational transitions linked to active site ligation in human thrombin: effect on the interaction with fibrinogen and the cleavable platelet receptor.	An experimental strategy based on solution viscosity perturbation allowed us to study the energetics of amide-substrates, p-aminobenzamidine (p-ABZ) and proflavin binding to the catalytic site of two proteolyzed forms of alpha-thrombin, i.e. zeta- and gamma T-thrombin. These thrombin derivatives are cleaved at the Leu144-Gly150 loop and at the fibrinogen recognition exosite (FRS), respectively. A phenomenological analysis of thermodynamic data showed that the amide substrates and p-ABZ interactions with zeta-thrombin were respectively, associated with a chemical compensation (i.e. the linear relationship between entropy and enthalpy of binding) and a hydrophobic phenomenon (i.e. a change in the standard heat capacity). The latter was slightly lower than that previously observed for a alpha-thrombin (0.78 +/- 0.25 versus 1.01 +/- 0.17 kcal/mol K). Both phenomenon were absent in gamma T-thrombin. The interaction of a alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin with macromolecular substrates that "bridge-bind" to both the catalytic site (CS) and fibrinogen recognition exosite (FRS), such as fibrinogen and the cleavable platelet receptor (CPR), was also evaluated. These interactions were studied by following fibrinopeptide A (FpA) release and by measuring intraplatelet Ca2+ changes induced by thrombin-CPR interaction. It was found that the free energy of activation (RT ln Kcat/Km) for both fibrinogen and CPR hydrolysis followed the same hierarchy, i.e. alpha > zeta > gamma. Moreover, the values of delta Cp for alpha-, zeta- and gamma T-thrombin interaction with p-ABZ were found to be linearly correlated to the free energy of activation for both fibrinogen and CPR cleavage. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that: (1) the Leu144-Gly150 loop and the FRS are both involved in the conformational transition linked to the binding of p-aminobenzamidine to the thrombin active site; (2) the extent of thrombin's capacity to undergo conformational transitions in alpha-, zeta- and gamma T forms is positively correlated to the free energy of activation for hydrolysis of macromolecular substrates interacting with both the catalytic domain and the FRS.
8384716	Molecular cloning and functional expression of 5-HT1E-like rat and human 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor genes.	Sequential polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed to amplify a unique sequence representing a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptor from rat hypothalamic cDNA. Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved amino acids from transmembrane domains III, V, and VI of known receptors [5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, and 5-HT2; 5-HT is serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine)] were used as primers for the sequential reactions. The resulting product was subcloned and used to screen a rat genomic library to identify a full-length clone (MR77) containing an intronless open reading frame encoding a 366-amino acid seven-transmembrane domain protein. The human homolog was isolated, and its encoded protein had 93% overall amino acid identity with the rat sequence. Within the conserved transmembrane domains, the sequences exhibit approximately 52%, 59%, 65%, and 68% amino acid identity with the known rat 5-HT1A, rat 5-HT1B, rat 5-HT1D, and human 5-HT1E receptors, respectively. MR77 was subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector system and expressed in CosM6 cells. Studies on broken cell preparations indicate that the expressed receptor exhibits 125I-labeled d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) binding that can be displaced by serotonin but not by other biogenic amines. The specific binding is displaced by the selective 5-HT1D agonist sumatriptan but not by the mixed 5-HT1A/1D agonist 5-carboxyamidotryptamine. 125I-labeled LSD binding was competitively antagonized by the ergot alkaloids methysergide and ergotamine. HeLa cells transfected with the MR77 gene exhibited inhibition of adenylate cyclase in response to serotonin. MR77 is expressed at low levels throughout the brain, with the greatest expression in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. MR77 thus represents a 5-HT receptor of the 5-HT1 class, and we propose that, based on the pharmacological characterization, MR77 represents an additional 5-HT1E-like receptor.
12373557	Stereospecific inhibition of monoamine uptake transporters by meta-hydroxyephedrine isomers.	Meta-hydroxyephedrine (HED) comprises four stereoisomers consisting of two enantiomeric pairs related to ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. HED is transported into adrenergic neurons and radiolabeled HED has been employed in positron emission tomography (PET) to image adrenergic neurons in vivo. To extend structure-activity analyses of binding sites within monoamine transporters and to determine which stereoisomer displayed the best selectivity for PET imaging applications, we tested the HED compounds for their abilities to inhibit [(3)H]neurotransmitter uptake into platelets, transfected cells, and chromaffin vesicles. We hypothesized that the HED compounds would be most potent at the norepinephrine transporter (NET) compared to the serotonin or dopamine transporters and that the 1R diastereomers would be more effective than 1S diastereomers. Supporting the hypotheses, all stereoisomers were most potent at the NET and the 1R,2S stereoisomer was the most potent inhibitor overall. However, the 1S,2R isomer may be preferred for PET applications because of better selectivity among the transporters and reduced neuronal recycling.
12852767	Tethered dimers as NAD synthetase inhibitors with antibacterial activity.	The solution-phase parallel synthesis of tethered dimers was employed to identify lead inhibitors of bacterial NAD synthetase. Active dimers contained two aromatic end groups joined by a polymethylene linker, with one end group containing a permanent positive charge. Effective inhibitors of NAD synthetase also inhibited the growth of Gram-positive (but not Gram-negative) bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains. The desmethyl precursors of active inhibitors lacked a permanent positive charge and were inactive as either enzyme inhibitors or antibacterial agents. Similarly, a close structural analogue of the most active inhibitors contained two additional ether oxygens in the tether and was inactive in both assays. These results are consistent with the premise that NAD synthetase inhibition is responsible for the antibacterial actions and support further studies on NAD synthetase as a new target for antibacterial agents.
17494858	Distinct patterns of mutations occurring in de novo AML versus AML arising in the setting of severe congenital neutropenia.	Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is an inborn disorder of granulopoiesis. Like most other bone marrow failure syndromes, it is associated with a marked propensity to transform into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia, with a cumulative rate of transformation to MDS/leukemia that exceeds 20%. The genetic (and/or epigenetic) changes that contribute to malignant transformation in SCN are largely unknown. In this study, we performed mutational profiling of 14 genes previously implicated in leukemogenesis using 14 MDS/leukemia samples from patients with SCN. We used high-throughput exon-based resequencing of whole-genome-amplified genomic DNA with a semiautomated method to detect mutations. The sensitivity and specificity of the sequencing pipeline was validated by determining the frequency of mutations in these 14 genes using 188 de novo AML samples. As expected, mutations of tyrosine kinase genes (FLT3, KIT, and JAK2) were common in de novo AML, with a cumulative frequency of 30%. In contrast, no mutations in these genes were detected in the SCN samples; instead, mutations of CSF3R, encoding the G-CSF receptor, were common. These data support the hypothesis that mutations of CSF3R may provide the "activated tyrosine kinase signal" that is thought to be important for leukemogenesis.
23409864	Compound and compositions as TGR5 agonists: WO2012082947.	The patent application WO2012082947 claims novel compounds as agonists of a plasma membrane-bound bile acid receptor TGR5. By activating TGR5, the agonists improve glycemic control and enhance energy expenditure. The basic generic claim of the patent covers pyrazole derivatives, different permutations on the core pyrazole ring are covered in the subsidiary claims. The claimed compounds are human TGR5 agonists having potency in the nM range.
23618921	Concurrent Regulation of the Transcription Factors Nrf2 and ATF4 Mediates the Enhancement of Glutathione Levels by the Flavonoid Fisetin.	Glutathione (GSH) and GSH-associated metabolism provide the major line of defense for the protection of cells from various forms of toxic stress. GSH also plays a key role in regulating the intracellular redox environment. Thus, maintenance of GSH levels is developing into an important therapeutic objective for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Among the transcription factors that play critical roles in GSH metabolism are NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Thus, compounds that can upregulate these transcription factors may be particularly useful as treatment options through their effects on GSH metabolism. We previously showed that the flavonoid fisetin not only increases basal levels of GSH but also maintains GSH levels under oxidative stress conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects have remained unknown until now. Here we show that fisetin rapidly increases the levels of both Nrf2 and ATF4 as well as Nrf2- and ATF4-dependent gene transcription via distinct mechanisms. Although fisetin greatly increases the stability of both Nrf2 and ATF4, only the effect on ATF4 is dependent on protein kinase activity. Using siRNA we found that ATF4, but not Nrf2, is important for fisetin's ability to increase GSH levels under basal conditions whereas both ATF4 and Nrf2 appear to cooperate to increase GSH levels under oxidative stress conditions. Based upon these results, we hypothesize that compounds able to increase GSH levels via multiple mechanisms, such as fisetin, will be particularly effective for maintaining GSH levels under a variety of different stresses.
23305850	Identification of aldo-keto reductases as NRF2-target marker genes in human cells.	Transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) plays a crucial role in the cellular defense against oxidative/electrophilic stress by up-regulating multiple antioxidant genes. Numerous studies with genetically modified animals have demonstrated that Nrf2 is a sensitivity determining factor upon the exposure to environmental chemicals including carcinogens. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that polymorphism in the human NRF2 promoter is associated with higher risks for developing acute lung injury, gastric mucosal inflammation, and nephritis. Therefore, the identification of reliable and effective human target genes of NRF2 may allow the monitoring of NRF2 activity and to predict individual sensitivity to environmental stress-induced damage. For this purpose, we investigated genes that are tightly controlled by NRF2 to establish markers for NRF2 activity in human cells. Firstly, in the normal human renal epithelial HK-2 cells, the measurement of the expression of 30 previously reported NRF2 target genes in response to NRF2 inducers (sulforaphane, tert-butylhydroquinone, cinnamic aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide) showed that the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C1 is highly inducible by all treatments. Accordantly, the basal and inducible expressions of AKRs were significantly attenuated in NRF2-silenced HK-2 cells. Whereas, cells with stable KEAP1 knockdown, which causes a modest NRF2 activation, demonstrated substantially increased levels of AKR1A1, 1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Secondly, the linkage between NRF2 and the AKRs was confirmed in human monocytic leukemia cell line U937, which can be a model of peripherally available blood cells. The treatment of U937 cells with NRF2 inducers including sulforaphane effectively elevated the expression of AKR1B1, 1B10, 1C1, 1C2, and 1C3. Whereas, the levels of both the basal and sulforaphane-inducible expression of AKR1C1 were significantly reduced in NRF2-silenced stable U937 cells compared to the control cells. Similarly, the inducible expression of AKR1C1 was observed in another human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 as well as in human primary blood CD14(+) monocytes. In conclusion, together with the high inducibility and NRF2 dependency shown in renal epithelial cells as well as in peripherally available blood cells, current findings suggest that AKRs can be utilized as a marker of NRF2 activity in human cells.
23418368	The Prevalence of Meeting A1C, Blood Pressure, and LDL Goals Among People With Diabetes, 1988-2010.	OBJECTIVETo determine the prevalence of people with diabetes who meet hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C), blood pressure (BP), and LDL cholesterol (ABC) recommendations, and their current statin use, factors associated with goal achievement, and changes in the proportion achieving goals between 1988 and 2010.RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODSData were cross-sectional from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1988-1994, 1999-2002, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010. Participants were 4,926 adults aged ≥20 years who self-reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes and completed the household interview and physical examination (n = 1,558 for valid LDL levels). Main outcome measures were A1C, BP, and LDL cholesterol, in accordance with the American Diabetes Association recommendations, and current use of statins.RESULTSIn 2007-2010, 52.5% of people with diabetes achieved A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol), 51.1% achieved BP <130/80 mmHg, 56.2% achieved LDL <100 mg/dL, and 18.8% achieved all three ABCs. These levels of control were significant improvements from 1988 to 1994 (all P < 0.05). Statin use significantly increased between 1988-1994 (4.2%) and 2007-2010 (51.4%, P < 0.01). Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Mexican Americans were less likely to meet A1C and LDL goals (P < 0.03), and non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to meet BP and LDL goals (P < 0.02). Compared with non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans were less likely to meet A1C goals (P < 0.01). Younger individuals were less likely to meet A1C and LDL goals.CONCLUSIONSDespite significant improvement during the past decade, achieving the ABC goals remains suboptimal among adults with diabetes, particularly in some minority groups. Substantial opportunity exists to further improve diabetes control and, thus, to reduce diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.
11255924	On the relationship between the dopamine transporter and the reinforcing effects of local anesthetics in rhesus monkeys: practical and theoretical concerns.	RATIONALE: Drugs that are self-administered appear to vary in their potency and effectiveness as positive reinforcers. Understanding mechanisms that determine relative effectiveness of drugs as reinforcers will enhance our understanding of drug abuse. OBJECTIVES: The hypothesis of the present study was that differences among dopamine transporter (DAT) ligands in potency and effectiveness as a positive reinforcers were related to potency and effectiveness as DA uptake inhibitors. Accordingly, self-administration of a group of local anesthetics that are DAT ligands was compared to their effects as DA uptake blockers in vitro in brain tissue. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys were allowed to self-administer cocaine and other local anesthetics i.v. under a progressive-ratio schedule. The same compounds were compared in standard in vitro DA uptake assays using monkey caudate tissue. RESULTS: The rank order of both potency and effectiveness as reinforcers was cocaine > dimethocaine > procaine > chloroprocaine. Tetracaine did not maintain self-administration. For inhibiting DA uptake, the potency order was cocaine > dimethocaine > tetracaine > procaine > chloro-procaine. At maximum, these compounds were equally effective in blocking DA uptake. Lidocaine did not inhibit DA uptake. CONCLUSIONS: The potency of local anesthetics as positive reinforcers is likely related to their potency as DA uptake inhibitors. Variation in their effectiveness as positive reinforcers was not a function of differences in effectiveness as DA uptake blockers, but may be related to relative potency over the concentrations that are achieved in vivo. Effects at sodium channels may limit the reinforcing effects of local anesthetics.
15184278	Clinical assessment of norepinephrine transporter blockade through biochemical and pharmacological profiles.	BACKGROUND: To assess the sensitivity of biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological markers of peripheral norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) function, we chronically antagonized NET by a range of doses of duloxetine [(+)-N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2 thiophenepropanamine], which blocks the NE reuptake process. METHODS AND RESULTS: Duloxetine was administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy volunteers. Plasma from duloxetine-treated subjects (ex vivo effect) dose-dependently decreased radioligand binding to human NET (maximum inhibition was 60%) (P=0.02). The dose of intravenous tyramine required to raise systolic blood pressure by 30 mm Hg (PD30) increased dose-dependently with duloxetine and was significant at the end of the 120-mg/d dosage (P<0.001). The plasma dihydoxyphenylglycol to NE (DHPG/NE) ratio was reduced significantly at 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d duloxetine (11.3 at baseline, 3.4 at 240 mg/d, P<0.001). Plasma NE was significantly increased starting at 120 mg/d duloxetine. Urine results (corrected for 24-hour creatinine excretion) showed a dose-dependent change from the baseline urinary excretion for NE, DHPG, and the DHPG/NE ratio. The most sensitive measure, the DHPG/NE ratio, was significant at the 80-mg dose. Urinary NE excretion was significantly raised after 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d duloxetine (P<0.001), the lowest dose used in the study. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the degree of NET blockade can be assessed with the plasma or urine DHPG/NE ratio and the pressor effect of tyramine. Also, the DHPG/NE ratio is more sensitive at the lower end of NET inhibition, whereas tyramine exhibits a linear relation, with NET inhibition commencing at a higher dose.
11961111	G protein-coupled receptors as direct targets of inhaled anesthetics.	The molecular pharmacology of inhalational anesthetics remains poorly understood. Despite accumulating evidence suggesting that neuronal membrane proteins are potential targets of inhaled anesthetics, most currently favored membrane protein targets lack any direct evidence for anesthetic binding. We report herein the location of the binding site for the inhaled anesthetic halothane at the amino acid residue level of resolution in the ligand binding cavity in a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor, bovine rhodopsin. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching and direct photoaffinity labeling with [(14)C]halothane suggested an interhelical location of halothane with a stoichiometry of 1 (halothane/rhodopsin molar ratio). Radiosequence analysis of [(14)C]halothane-labeled rhodopsin revealed that halothane contacts an amino acid residue (Trp265) lining the ligand binding cavity in the transmembrane core of the receptor. The predicted functional consequence, competition between halothane and the ligand retinal, was shown here by spectroscopy and is known to exist in vivo. These data suggest that competition with endogenous ligands may be a general mechanism of the action of halothane at this large family of signaling proteins.
17507169	Cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus and central control of penile erection: immunocytochemistry, autoradiography and behavioral studies.	[N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxyamide] (SR 141716A), a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of male rats, induces penile erection. This effect is mediated by the release of glutamic acid, which in turn activates central oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection. Double immunofluorescence studies with selective antibodies against CB1 receptors, glutamic acid transporters (vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGlut1 and VGlut2), glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD67) and oxytocin itself, have shown that CB1 receptors in the PVN are located mainly in GABAergic terminals and fibers surrounding oxytocinergic cell bodies. As GABAergic synapses in the PVN impinge directly on oxytocinergic neurons or on excitatory glutamatergic synapses, which also impinge on oxytocinergic neurons, these results suggest that the blockade of CB1 receptors decreases GABA release in the PVN, increasing in turn glutamatergic neurotransmission to activate oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection. Autoradiography studies with [(3)H](-)-CP 55,940 show that chronic treatment with SR 141716A for 15 days twice daily (1 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increases the density of CB1 receptors in the PVN. This increase occurs concomitantly with an almost twofold increase in the pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A injected into the PVN as compared with control rats. The present findings confirm that PVN CB1 receptors, localized mainly in GABAergic synapses that control in an inhibitory fashion excitatory synapses, exert an inhibitory control on penile erection, demonstrating for the first time that chronic blockade of CB1 receptors by SR 141716A increases the density of these receptors in the PVN. This increase is related to an enhanced pro-erectile effect of SR 141716A, which is still present 3 days after the end of the chronic treatment.
23454835	Alternariol induces abnormal nuclear morphology and cell cycle arrest in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages.	The mycotoxin alternariol (AOH), a frequent contaminant in fruit and cereal products, is known to induce DNA damage with subsequent cell cycle arrest. Here we elucidated the effects of AOH on stages of cell cycle progression using the RAW 264.7 macrophage model. AOH resulted in an accumulation of cells in the G2/M-phase (4N). Most cells exhibited a large G2 nucleus whereas numbers of true mitotic cells were reduced relative to control. Both cyclin B1 and p-cdc2 levels increased, while cyclin B1 remained in the cytoplasm; suggesting arrest in the G2/M transition point. Remarkably, after exposure to AOH for 24h, most of the cells exhibited abnormally shaped nuclei, as evidenced by partly divided nuclei, nuclear blebs, polyploidy and micronuclei (MN). AOH treatment also induced abnormal Aurora B bridges, suggesting that cytokinesis was interfered within cells undergoing karyokinesis. A minor part of the resultant G1 tetraploid (4N) cells re-entered the S-phase and progressed to 8N cells.
17479245	Glucagon receptor antagonism improves islet function in mice with insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet.	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increased glucagon secretion predicts deterioration of glucose tolerance, and high glucagon levels contribute to hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of glucagon action may therefore be a potential novel target to reduce hyperglycaemia. Here, we investigated whether chronic treatment with a glucagon receptor antagonist (GRA) improves islet dysfunction in female mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 8 weeks of HFD, mice were treated with a small molecule GRA (300 mg/kg, gavage once daily) for up to 30 days. Insulin secretion was studied after oral and intravenous administration of glucose and glucagon secretion after intravenous arginine. Islet morphology was examined and insulin secretion and glucose oxidation were measured in isolated islets. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose levels were reduced by GRA (6.0 +/- 0.2 vs 7.4 +/- 0.5 mmol/l; p = 0.017). The acute insulin response to intravenous glucose was augmented (1,300 +/- 110 vs 790 +/- 64 pmol/l; p < 0.001). The early insulin response to oral glucose was reduced in mice on HFD + GRA (1,890 +/- 160 vs 3,040 +/- 420 pmol/l; p = 0.012), but glucose excursions were improved. Intravenous arginine significantly increased the acute glucagon response (129 +/- 12 vs 36 +/- 6 ng/l in controls; p < 0.01), notably without affecting plasma glucose. GRA caused a modest increase in alpha cell mass, while beta cell mass was similar to that in mice on HFD + vehicle. Isolated islets displayed improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after GRA treatment (0.061 +/- 0.007 vs 0.030 +/- 0.004 pmol islet(-1) h(-1) at 16.7 mmol/l glucose; p < 0.001), without affecting islet glucose oxidation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Chronic glucagon receptor antagonism in HFD-fed mice improves islet sensitivity to glucose and increases insulin secretion, suggesting improvement of key defects underlying impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.
16424790	Comparison of captopril and enalapril to study the role of the sulfhydryl-group in improvement of endothelial dysfunction with ACE inhibitors in high dieted methionine mice.	To examine the role of sulfhydryl (-SH) group in improvement of endothelial dysfunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in experimental high dose of methionine dieted rats. We compared the effects of Captopril (an ACE inhibitor with -SH group), enalapril (an ACE-inhibitor without -SH group), N-acetylcysteine (only -SH group not ACE inhibitor) on endothelial dysfunction injured by methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into seven groups: control group, L-methionine group, low dose Captopril (15 mg/kg), middle dose Captopril (30 mg/kg), high dose Captopril (45 mg/kg), enalapril (20 mg/kg), N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg); control group were intragastric gavaged by water and others groups were intragastric gavaged by L-methionine and drugs in water one time every day. Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR), sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced endothelium-independent relaxation of aortic rings were examined. Paraoxonase1 (PON1) and ACE activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum were analyzed. It was found that a single intragastric gavage by L-methionine resulted in inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation, markedly increased the serum level of malondialdehyde and decreased the activity of PON1 and SOD, similarly decreased the level of NO in the serum; but had no effects on endothelium-independent relaxation and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity compared with the control group. Given the treatment with three doses of Captopril (15 approximately 45 mg/kg) markedly attenuated inhibition of vasodilator responses to ACh, and eliminated the increased level of malondialdehyde, the decreased level of NO, activity of PON1 and SOD in serum by single intragastric gavaged L-methionine. However, there were some significant differences among Captopril (30 mg/kg or 45 mg/kg), enalapril (20 mg/kg), and N-acetylcysteine particular in the activity of PON1 and ACE. These results suggested that Captopril can protect the vascular endothelium against the damages induced by L-methionine in rats, and the beneficial effects of Captopril may be related to attenuating the decrease in PON1 activity and NO levels. Furthermore, this protective effect may be concerned with the sulfhydryl group.
22989703	Comparative antioxidant effects of lycopene, apo-10'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14'-lycopenoic acid in human macrophages exposed to H2O2 and cigarette smoke extract.	Much of the beneficial effects of tomato lycopene in the prevention of chronic diseases has been attributed to its antioxidant properties, which could be mediated by its metabolites and/or oxidation products. However, the biological functions of these lycopene derivatives remain still unknown. In the present study, we evaluated and compared the antioxidant efficacy of the lycopene eccentric cleavage products apo-10'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14'-lycopenoic acid in counteracting the oxidative effects of H(2)O(2) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in THP-1 macrophages. Both apo-10'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14'-lycopenoic acid were able to inhibit spontaneous and H(2)O(2)-induced ROS production in a dose-dependent manner. Such an effect was accompanied by an inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation, by NF-κB inactivation, and by inhibition of hsp-70 and hsp-90 expressions. Both apo-lycopenoic acids also decreased CSE-induced ROS production, 8-OHdG formation and reduced the increase in NOX-4 and COX-2 expressions caused by CSE. However, in both the models of oxidative stress, apo-14'-lycopenoic acid was much more potent as an antioxidant than apo-10'-lycopenoic acid, showing antioxidant properties similar to lycopene. These data strongly suggest that apo-lycopenoic acids, and particularly apo-14'-lycopenoic acid, may mediate some of the antioxidant functions of lycopene in cells.
23256446	Metabolic effects of honey in type 1 diabetes mellitus: a randomized crossover pilot study.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of 12-week honey consumption on patients suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). This was a randomized crossover clinical trial done in the National Institute for Diabetes and Endocrinology, Cairo, Egypt. Twenty patients of both sexes aged 4-18 years with type 1 DM and HbA1C<10% participated in the study. They were randomized into two equal groups (intervention to control and control to intervention). The dietary intervention was 12-week honey consumption in a dose of 0.5 mL/kg body weight per day. The main outcome measures were serum glucose, lipids, and C-peptide, and anthropometric measurements. None of participants were lost in follow-up. The intervention resulted in significant decreases in subscapular skin fold thickness (SSFT; P=.002), fasting serum glucose (FSG; P=.001), total cholesterol (P=.0001), serum triglycerides (TG; P=.0001), and low-density lipoprotein (P=.0009), and significant increases in fasting C-peptide (FCP; P=.0004) and 2-h postprandial C-peptide (PCP; P=.002). As possible long-term effects of honey after its withdrawal, statistically significant reductions in midarm circumference (P=.000), triceps skin fold thickness (P=.006), SSFT (P=.003), FSG (P=.005), 2-h postprandial serum glucose (P=.000), TG (P=.003), and HbA1C (P=.043), and significant increases in FCP (P=.002) and PCP (P=.003) were observed. This small clinical trial suggests that long-term consumption of honey might have positive effects on the metabolic derangements of type 1 DM.
23432124	Studies on an (S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist IKM-159: asymmetric synthesis, neuroactivity, and structural characterization.	IKM-159 was developed and identified as a member of a new class of heterotricyclic glutamate analogues that act as AMPA receptor-selective antagonists. However, it was not known which enantiomer of IKM-159 was responsible for its pharmacological activities. Here, we report in vivo and in vitro neuronal activities of both enantiomers of IKM-159 prepared by enantioselective asymmetric synthesis. By employment of (R)-2-amino-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol as a chiral auxiliary, (2R)-IKM-159 and the (2S)-counterpart were successfully synthesized in 0.70% and 1.5% yields, respectively, over a total of 18 steps. Both behavioral and electrophysiological assays showed that the biological activity observed for the racemic mixture was reproduced only with (2R)-IKM-159, whereas the (2S)-counterpart was inactive in both assays. Racemic IKM-159 was crystallized with the ligand-binding domain of GluA2, and the structure revealed a complex containing (2R)-IKM-159 at the glutamate binding site. (2R)-IKM-159 locks the GluA2 in an open form, consistent with a pharmacological action as competitive antagonist of AMPA receptors.
23564313	Vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells is mediated by Ras homologous A protein (Rho A) via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms.	Despite the availability of melanoma treatment at the primary site, the recurrence of local melanoma can metastasize to any distant organ. Currently, the available therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma are of limited benefit. Thus, the functional analysis of conventional therapies may help to improve their efficiency in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. In the present study, the exposure of melanoma cells to vinblastine was found to trigger apoptosis as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of both cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor, activation of caspase-9 and 3, and cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose)-Polymerase. Also, vinblastine enhances the phosphorylation of Ras homologous protein A, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, the release of intracellular Ca(2+), as well as the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-jun-N-terminal kinase, p38, inhibitor of kappaBα (IκBα) kinase, and inositol requiring enzyme 1α. In addition, vinblastine induces the DNA-binding activities of the transcription factor NF-κB, HSF1, AP-1, and ATF-2, together with the expression of HSP70 and Bax proteins. Moreover, inhibitory experiments addressed a central role for Rho A in the regulation of vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms. In conclusion, the present study addresses for the first time a central role for Rho A in the modulation of vinblastine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells and thereby provides an insight into the molecular action of vinblastine in melanoma treatment.
16938288	Telmisartan downregulates angiotensin II type 1 receptor through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.	OBJECTIVE: Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist, was found to have a unique property: it is a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Since previous studies have demonstrated that PPARgamma activators suppressed AT1R expression, we examined whether telmisartan affects AT1R expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. METHODS: Vascular smooth muscle cells were derived from the thoracic aorta of Wistar-Kyoto rat. Northern and Western blotting analysis were used to examine AT1R mRNA and protein expression, respectively. The DEAE-dextran method was used for transfection, and the promoter activity of AT1R was examined by luciferase assay. RESULTS: Telmisartan decreased the expression of AT1R at the mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Decreased AT1R promoter activity with unchanged mRNA stability suggested that telmisartan suppressed AT1R gene expression at the transcriptional level. However, the expression of AT1R was not suppressed by other AT1R antagonists such as candesartan or olmesartan. Since the suppression of AT1R expression was prevented by pretreatment with GW9662, a PPARgamma antagonist, PPARgamma should have participated in the process. The deletion and mutation analysis of the AT1R gene promoter indicated that a GC box located in the proximal promoter region is responsible for the telmisartan-induced downregulation. CONCLUSION: Our data provides a novel insight into an effect of telmisartan: telmisartan inhibits AT1R gene expression through PPARgamma activation. The dual inhibition of angiotensin II function by telmisartan - AT1R blockade and downregulation - would contribute to more complete inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.
23494236	Reinforcement enhancing effects of nicotine via smoking.	RATIONALE: In animals, nicotine enhances reinforcement from stimuli unrelated to nicotine intake. Human research is suggestive but has not clearly shown a similar influence of nicotine. OBJECTIVES: We assessed acute effects of nicotine via smoking on enhancement of positive (money, music) or negative (termination of noise) reinforcers, or no "reward" (control). These different rewards determined the generalizability of nicotine effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dependent (n = 25) and nondependent (n = 27) smokers participated in three sessions, each after overnight abstinence. Using a within-subjects design, sessions involved no smoking or smoking denicotinized (0.05 mg) or nicotine (0.6 mg) Quest(R) brand cigarettes. For comparison, a fourth session involved no abstinence prior to smoking one's own brand to gauge responses under typical nicotine satiation. Reinforcement was assessed by responses on a simple operant computer task for the rewards, each available singly on a progressive ratio schedule during separate trials. RESULTS: The reinforcing effect of music, but not other rewards, was greater due to the nicotine cigarette, compared to the denicotinized cigarette or no smoking. Reinforcement enhancing effects of nicotine did not differ between dependent and nondependent groups, indicating no influence of withdrawal relief. Responding due to acute nicotine after abstinence was very similar to responding to one's own brand after no abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Acute nicotine intake per se from smoking after abstinence enhances the reinforcing value of rewards unassociated with smoking, perhaps in a manner comparable to ad lib smoking after no abstinence. Nicotine's reinforcement enhancing effects may be specific to certain rewards, perhaps those sensory in nature.
23116965	Antiarrhythmic effects of (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate, a novel sodium channel agonist in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes.	(-)-Epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), a polyphenol extracted from green tea, has been proposed as an effective compound for improving cardiac contractility. However, the therapeutic potential of ECG on the treatment of arrhythmia remains unknown. We investigated the direct actions of ECG on the modulation of ion currents and cardiac cell excitability in the primary culture of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM), which is considered a hypertrophic model for analysis of myocardial arrhythmias. By using the whole-cell patch-clamp configurations, we found ECG enhanced the slowly inactivating component of voltage-gated Na(+) currents (I(Na)) in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1-100 μM) with an EC(50) value of 3.8 μM. ECG not only shifted the current-voltage relationship of peak I(Na) to the hyperpolarizing direction but also accelerated I(Na) recovery kinetics. Working at a concentration level of I(Na) enhancement, ECG has no notable effect on voltage-gated K(+) currents and L-type Ca(2+) currents. With culture time increment, the firing rate of spontaneous action potential (sAP) in NRVMs was gradually decreased until spontaneous early after-depolarization (EAD) was observed after about one week culture. ECG increased the firing rate of normal sAP about two-fold without waveform alteration. Interestingly, the bradycardia-dependent EAD could be significantly restored by ECG in fast firing rate to normal sAP waveform. The expression of dominant cardiac sodium channel subunit, Nav1.5, was consistently detected throughout the culture periods. Our results reveal how ECG, the novel I(Na) agonist, may act as a promising candidate in clinical applications on cardiac arrhythmias.
12438517	Yohimbine dimers exhibiting selectivity for the human alpha 2C-adrenoceptor subtype.	Yohimbine is a potent and selective alpha2- versus alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist. To date, drugs with high specificity for the alpha2-adrenoceptor show marginal selectivity among the three alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes. Initial studies showed that yohimbine was about 4- and 15-fold more selective for the human alpha2C-adrenoceptor in comparison with the alpha2A- and alpha2B-adrenoceptors, respectively. To improve on this alpha2-adrenoceptor subtype selectivity, a series of yohimbine dimers (varying from n = 2 to 24 spacer atoms) were prepared and evaluated for receptor binding on human alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Each dimeric analog showed higher affinities for alpha2A- and alpha2C-adrenoceptor versus the alpha2B-adrenoceptor; and yohimbine dimers with spacers of n = 2, 3, 4, 18, and 24 exhibited selectivity for the alpha2C-adrenoceptor. The yohimbine dimers n = 3 and n = 24 showed the highest potency and selectivity (32- and 82-fold. respectively) for the alpha2C-adrenoceptor in receptor binding and in functional studies (42- and 29-fold, respectively) measuring cAMP changes using a cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay. The dimers (n = 3 and n = 24) had high selectivity (>1000-fold) for the alpha2C-adrenoceptor compared with the three alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes. These findings demonstrate that the addition of spacer linkages to bivalent yohimbine molecules provides a successful approach to the development of ligands that are potent and highly selective for the alpha2C-adrenoceptor.
23410126	Genome-wide integrated analyses of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer based on high-throughput technology.	The androgen receptor (AR) is a steroid hormone receptor that functions as a ligand-dependent transcriptional factor, which plays a key role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Recent advancement in high throughput technologies including microarrays and deep-sequencing provides unbiased genome-wide knowledge on the AR signaling including datasets for androgen-regulated gene expression and genomic binding sites for AR. In the present review, we will briefly summarize the main features of the AR signaling as well as the individual AR target genes identified by the integration of multiple datasets in prostate cancer. Cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) is also featured as a unique transcriptome method, which particularly determines the androgen-dependent transcription start points in prostate cancer.
17459764	n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids induce the expression of COX-2 via PPARgamma activation in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells.	Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) n-3 inhibit inflammation, in vivo and in vitro in keratinocytes. We examined in HaCaT keratinocyte cell line whether eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) a n-3 PUFA, gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) a n-6 PUFA, and arachidic acid a saturated fatty acid, modulate expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme pivotal to skin inflammation and reparation. We demonstrate that only treatment of HaCaT with GLA and EPA or a PPARgamma ligand (roziglitazone), induced COX-2 expression (protein and mRNA). Moreover stimulation of COX-2 promoter activity was increased by those PUFAs or rosiglitazone. The inhibitory effects of GW9662 and T0070907 (PPARgamma antagonists), on COX-2 expression and on stimulation of COX-2 promoter activity by EPA and GLA suggest that PPARgamma is implicated in COX-2 induction. Finally, PLA2 inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate blocked the PUFA effects on COX-2 induction, promoter activity and arachidonic acid mobilization suggesting involvement of AA metabolites in PPAR activation. These findings demonstrate that n-3 and n-6 PUFA increased PPARgamma activity is necessary for the COX-2 induction in HaCaT human keratinocyte cells. Given the anti-inflammatory properties of EPA, we suggest that induction of COX-2 in keratinocytes may be important in the anti-inflammatory and protective mechanism of action of PUFAs n-3 or n-6.
23402270	Binding between proteins and cationic spherical polyelectrolyte brushes: effect of pH, ionic strength, and stoichiometry.	Cationic spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPBs) were synthesized by photoemulsion polymerization, consisting of a polystyrene core with a diameter around 80 nm and a poly(2-aminoethylmethacrylate hydrochloride) (PAEMH) shell with a thickness from 10 to 50 nm densely grafted on the core surface. The binding of various proteins onto SPBs was observed by turbidimetric titration, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The binding, aggregation, and releasing of proteins by SPB can be tuned by modulating pH. The pH regions of binding for bovine serum albumin (BSA), β-lactoglobulin (BLG), and papain onto SPBs are markedly different and tunable by ionic strength and stoichiometry between protein and SPB. Binding energetics, affinity, and amount of various proteins onto cationic SPBs were determined by ITC. These findings lay the foundation for SPB applications in the protein purification and selective immobilization of different proteins, enzymes, and antibodies.
16357751	Selective costimulation modulators: a novel approach for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.	T cells have a central role in the orchestration of the immune pathways that contribute to the inflammation and joint destruction characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The requirement for a dual signal for T-cell activation and the construction of a fusion protein that prevents engagement of the costimulatory molecules required for this activation has led to a new approach to RA therapy. This approach is mechanistically distinct from other currently used therapies; it targets events early rather than late in the immune cascade, and it results in immunomodulation rather than complete immunosuppression. The fusion protein abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator that avidly binds to the CD80/CD86 ligands on an antigen-presenting cell, resulting in the inability of these ligands to engage the CD28 receptor on the T cell. Abatacept dose-dependently reduces T-cell proliferation, serum concentrations of acute-phase reactants, and other markers of inflammation, including the production of rheumatoid factor by B cells. Recent studies have provided consistent evidence that treatment with abatacept results in a rapid onset of efficacy that is maintained over the course of treatment in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies. This efficacy includes patient-centered outcomes and radiographic measurement of disease progression. Abatacept has also demonstrated a very favorable safety profile to date. This article reviews the rationale for this therapeutic approach and highlights some of the recent studies that demonstrate the benefits obtained by using abatacept. This clinical experience indicates that abatacept is a significant addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of patients with RA.
23454148	Effect of protein malnutrition on the metabolism and toxicity of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C in rat stomach.	This study investigated the effect of protein malnutrition on metabolism and toxicity of cisplatin (CP), 5-fluorouracil (FU) and mitomycin C (MMC) in rat stomach. Weanling male Wistar rats received a normal (24%) or low (2.5%) protein diet for 28days and were allocated into: normally-fed control, protein-malnourished control (PM), 3 normally-fed drug-treated groups and 3 protein-malnourished drug-treated groups (PM-CP, PM-FU and PM-MMC). Cisplatin and MMC were injected intraperitoneally (8mg/kg on day 26 and 1mg/kg/day for 7days, respectively). 5-Fluorouracil was given orally (50mg/kg/day for 5days). Compared with normally-fed counterparts, PM-CP rats exhibited higher glutathione S-transferase, aminopeptidase N and cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase (CCBL) and lower gamma-glutamyltransferase activities, PM-FU rats exhibited decreased dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 1A1/2 activities and PM-MMC rats showed higher quinone reductase and depleted xanthine oxidase activities. Protein-malnourished drug-treated groups exhibited exacerbated gastrotoxicity, relative to normally-fed counterparts, manifested by lower mucus levels, higher permeability and histopathological deterioration, along with increased oxidative stress in PM-CP rats and exaggerated prostaglandin E2 production in PM-MMC rats. Conclusively, protein malnutrition alters CP, FU and MMC metabolism in rat stomach by enhancing CCBL pathway for CP activation, delaying FU elimination and activating two-electron reduction of MMC, potentiating their gastrotoxicity.
16480505	Roles of rifampicin in drug-drug interactions: underlying molecular mechanisms involving the nuclear pregnane X receptor.	Rifampicin, an important drug in the treatment of tuberculosis, is used extensively despite its broad effects on drug-drug interactions, creating serious problems. The clinical importance of such interactions includes autoinduction leading to suboptimal or failed treatment. The concomitantly administered effects of rifampicin on other drugs can result in their altered metabolism or transportation that are metabolised by cytochromes P450 or transported by p-glycoprotein in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. This review paper summarises recent findings with emphases on the molecular mechanisms used to explain these broad drug-drug interactions. In general, rifampicin can act on a pattern: rifampicin activates the nuclear pregnane X receptor that in turn affects cytochromes P450, glucuronosyltransferases and p-glycoprotein activities. This pattern of action may explain many of the rifampicin inducing drug-drug interactions. However, effects through other mechanisms have also been reported and these make any explanation of such drug-drug interactions more complex.
23250811	Curcumin improves TNBS-induced colitis in rats by inhibiting IL-27 expression via the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.	Curcumin is a widely used spice with anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. It has been reported to have beneficial effects in experimental colitis. This study explored whether curcumin improves colonic inflammation in a rat colitis model through inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and IL-27 expression. After induction of colitis with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, rats were intragastrically administered with curcumin or sulfasalazine daily for one week. Rat intestinal mucosa was collected for evaluation of the disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, and histological score. Myeloperoxidase activity was detected by immunohistochemistry, and mRNA and protein expression levels of TLR4, NF-κB, and IL-27 in colonic mucosa were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Compared with the untreated colitis group, the curcumin-treated group showed significant decreases in the disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, histological score, myeloperoxidase activity, and expressions of NF-κB mRNA, IL-27 mRNA, TLR4 protein, NF-κB p65 protein, and IL-27 p28 protein (p < 0.05). TLR4 mRNA expression did not differ between groups. Disease activity index decreased more rapidly in the curcumin-treated group than in the sulfasalazine-treated group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in TLR4, NF-κB, and IL-27 mRNA and proteins between curcumin-treated and sulfasalazine-treated groups. Curcumin shows significant therapeutic effects on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis that are comparable to sulfasalazine. The anti-inflammatory actions of curcumin on colitis may involve inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and of IL-27 expression.
17015640	Licofelone, a balanced inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, reduces inflammation in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis.	Licofelone, a dual anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits 5-lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, may have a better cardiovascular profile that cycloxygenase-2 inhibitors due to cycloxygenase-1 blockade-mediated antithrombotic effect and a better gastrointestinal tolerability. We examined the anti-inflammatory effect of licofelone on atherosclerotic lesions as well as in isolated neutrophils from whole blood of rabbits compared with a selective inhibitor of COX-2, rofecoxib. We also assessed the antithrombotic effect of licofelone in rabbit platelet-rich plasma. For this purpose, 30 rabbits underwent injury of femoral arteries, and they were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg/day licofelone or 5 mg/kg/day rofecoxib or no treatment during 4 weeks with atherogenic diet in all cases. Ten healthy rabbits were used as controls. Neutrophils and platelets were isolated from peripheral blood of rabbits for ex vivo studies. Licofelone reduced intima/media ratio in injured arteries, the macrophages infiltration in the neointimal area, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) gene expression, and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in rabbit atheroma. Moreover, licofelone inhibited COX-2 and 5-LOX protein expression in vascular lesions. Rofecoxib only diminished COX-2 protein expression and MCP-1 gene expression in vascular atheroma. Prostaglandin E(2) in rabbit plasma was attenuated by both drugs. Licofelone almost abolished 5-LOX activity by inhibiting leukotriene B4 generation in rabbit neutrophils and prevented platelet thromboxane B2 production from whole blood. Licofelone reduces neointimal formation and inflammation in an atherosclerotic rabbit model more markedly than rofecoxib. This effect, together with the antiplatelet activity of licofelone, suggests that this drug may have a favorable cardiovascular profile.
17090056	Transition-state structure of human 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase.	Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) and computer modeling using density functional theory were used to approximate the transition state of human 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP). KIEs were measured on the arsenolysis of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) catalyzed by MTAP and were corrected for the forward commitment to catalysis. Intrinsic KIEs were obtained for [1'-(3)H], [1'-(14)C], [2'-(3)H], [4'-(3)H], [5'-(3)H(2)], [9-(15)N], and [Me-(3)H(3)] MTAs. The primary intrinsic KIEs (1'-(14)C and 9-(15)N) suggest that MTAP has a dissociative S(N)1 transition state with its cationic center at the anomeric carbon and insignificant bond order to the leaving group. The 9-(15)N intrinsic KIE of 1.039 also establishes an anionic character for the adenine leaving group, whereas the alpha-primary 1'-(14)C KIE of 1.031 indicates significant nucleophilic participation at the transition state. Computational matching of the calculated EIEs to the intrinsic isotope effects places the oxygen nucleophile 2.0 Angstrom from the anomeric carbon. The 4'-(3)H KIE is sensitive to the polarization of the 3'-OH group. Calculations suggest that a 4'-(3)H KIE of 1.047 is consistent with ionization of the 3'-OH group, indicating formation of a zwitterion at the transition state. The transition state has cationic character at the anomeric carbon and is anionic at the 3'-OH oxygen, with an anionic leaving group. The isotope effects predicted a 3'-endo conformation for the ribosyl zwitterion, corresponding to a H1'-C1'-C2'-H2' torsional angle of 33 degrees. The [Me-(3)H(3)] and [5'-(3)H(2)] KIEs arise predominantly from the negative hyperconjugation of the lone pairs of sulfur with the sigma (C-H) antibonding orbitals. Human MTAP is characterized by a late S(N)1 transition state with significant participation of the phosphate nucleophile.
16268464	Association of MTRRA66G polymorphism (but not of MTHFR C677T and A1298C, MTRA2756G, TCN C776G) with homocysteine and coronary artery disease in the French population.	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism (MTHFR C677T) is an established determinant of homocysteine plasma level (t-Hcys) while its association with coronary artery disease (CAD) seems to be more limited. In contrast, the association of the substitutions A2756G of methionine synthase (MTR), A66G of methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) and C776G of transcobalamin (TCN) to both t-Hcys and CAD needs to be evaluated further. The objective was to evaluate the association of these polymorphisms with t-Hcys and CAD in a French population. We investigated the individual and combined effects of these polymorphisms and of vitamin B12 and folates with t-Hcys in 530 CAD patients and 248 matched healthy controls. t-Hcys was higher in the CAD group than in controls (11.8 vs 10.4 microM, P < 0.0001) and in carriers of MTRRAA and MTHFR 677TT than in those carrying the most frequent allele of both polymorphisms (13.8 vs 11.4 microM, P = 0.0102 and 12.5 vs 11.0 mM, P = 0.0065 respectively). The frequency of MTRR A allele was higher in CAD patients than in controls (0.48 [95% CI: 0.44-0.52] vs 0.38 [95% CI: 0.32-0.44], P = 0.0081) while no difference was observed for MTHFR 677T frequency. In multivariate analysis, t-Hcys > median and MTRRAA genotype were two significant independent predictors of CAD with respective odds ratios of 3.1 (95 % CI: 1.8-5.1, P < 0.0001) and 4.5 (95% CI: 1.5-13.1, P = 0.0051). In conclusion, in contrast to North Europe studies, MTRRAA genotype is a genetic determinant of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia associated with CAD in a French population without vitamin fortification.
2982865	Multiple affinity states of opiate receptor in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells. Opiate agonist association rate is a function of receptor occupancy.	The existence of multiple affinity states for the opiate receptor in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells has been demonstrated by competition binding studies with tritiated diprenorphine and [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE). In the presence of 10 mM Mg2+, all receptors exist in a high affinity state with Kd = 1.88 +/- 0.16 nM. Addition of 10 microM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) decreased the affinity of DADLE to Kd = 8.08 +/- 0.93 nM. However, in the presence of 100 mM Na+, which is required for opiate inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, analysis of competition binding data revealed three sites: the first, consisting of 17.5% of total receptor population has a Kd = 0.38 +/- 0.18 nM; the second, 50.6% of the population, has a Kd = 6.8 +/- 2.2 nM; and the third, 31.9% of the population, has a Kd of 410 +/- 110 nM. Thus, in the presence of sodium, a high affinity complex between receptor (R), GTP binding component (Ni), and ligand (L) was formed which was different from that formed in the absence of sodium. These multiple affinity states of receptor in the hybrid cells are agonist-specific, and the percentage of total opiate receptor in high affinity state is relatively constant in various concentrations of Na+. Multiple affinity states of opiate receptor can be demonstrated further by Scatchard analysis of saturation binding studies with [3H]DADLE. In the presence of Mg2+, or Gpp(NH)p, analysis of [3H]DADLE binding demonstrates that opiate receptor can exist in a single affinity state, with apparent Kd values of [3H]DADLE in 10 mM Mg2+ = 1.75 +/- 0.28 nM and in 10 microM Gpp(NH)p = 0.85 +/- 0.12 nM. There is a reduction of Bmax value from 0.19 +/- 0.02 nM in the presence of Mg2+ to 0.14 +/- 0.03 nM in the presence of Gpp(NH)p. In the presence of 100 mM Na+, Scatchard analysis of saturation binding of [3H]DADLE reveals nonlinear plots; two-site analysis of the curves yields Kd = 0.43 +/- 0.09 and 7.9 +/- 3.2 nM. These Kd values are analogous to that obtained with competition binding studies. Again, this conversion of single site binding Scatchard plots to multiple sites binding plots in the presence of Na+ is restricted to 3H-agonist binding only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
