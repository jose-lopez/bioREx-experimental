[SEP] Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on @ChemicalSrc$ lithium-induced @/ChemicalSrc$ chronic renal failure in rats . Rats with @ChemicalSrc$ lithium-induced @/ChemicalSrc$ @DiseaseTgt$ nephropathy @/DiseaseTgt$ were subjected to high protein ( HP ) feeding , uninephrectomy ( NX ) or a combination of these , in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure . Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a @ChemicalSrc$ lithium-containing @/ChemicalSrc$ diet ( 50 mmol/kg ) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet , HP diet ( 40 vs. 19 % ) , NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks . Corresponding @ChemicalSrc$ non-lithium @/ChemicalSrc$ pretreated groups were generated . When comparing all @ChemicalSrc$ lithium @/ChemicalSrc$ treated versus @ChemicalSrc$ non-lithium-treated @/ChemicalSrc$ groups , @ChemicalSrc$ lithium @/ChemicalSrc$ caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow ( as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules ) or @ChemicalSrc$ lithium @/ChemicalSrc$ clearance . Consequently , @ChemicalSrc$ lithium @/ChemicalSrc$ pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional @ChemicalSrc$ Li @/ChemicalSrc$ excretion . @ChemicalSrc$ Lithium @/ChemicalSrc$ also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis . HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in @ChemicalSrc$ lithium @/ChemicalSrc$ pretreated rats . NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which , however , was ameliorated by HP . NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in @ChemicalSrc$ Li-pretreated @/ChemicalSrc$ rats . The results indicate that @ChemicalSrc$ Li-induced @/ChemicalSrc$ @DiseaseTgt$ nephropathy @/DiseaseTgt$ , even when the GFR is only modestly reduced , is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension .

Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn 's disease , a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of @ChemicalSrc$ fusidic acid @/ChemicalSrc$ treatment in chronic active , therapy-resistant patients . Eight Crohn 's disease patients were included . @ChemicalSrc$ Fusidic acid @/ChemicalSrc$ was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.d.s . and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks . The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score . Five of 8 patients ( 63 % ) improved during @ChemicalSrc$ fusidic acid @/ChemicalSrc$ treatment : 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks . There were no serious clinical side effects , but dose reduction was required in two patients because of @DiseaseTgt$ nausea @/DiseaseTgt$ . Biochemically , an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases ( 63 % ) , and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment . All reversed to pre-treatment levels after cessation of treatment . The results of this pilot study suggest that @ChemicalSrc$ fusidic acid @/ChemicalSrc$ may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn 's disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective . Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of @ChemicalSrc$ fusidic acid @/ChemicalSrc$ at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease , we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated .	1 5 5 5 1 7 1|6|7 1|6|7 1|7 1|6|7 1 12 1 15 15 12 15 18 16 1 22 25 25 25 25 30 30 30 30 25 30 33 31 35 33 25 40 37 40 56 43 43 40 46 46 43 50 50 50 46 56 54 54 56 56 56 58 56 60 58 60 60 67 63|67 63|67 67 63|67 60 73 70 73 70 73 58 56 80 80 77 80 82 82 82 82 83|84|88 83|84|88 84|88 83|84|88 88 88 88 92 92 88 96 95 96 92 88 88 100 102 102 88 106 106 106 102 102 111 111 114 114 114 114 120 120 120 120 120 114 114 124 124 125 125 128 128 125 128 125 135 131|135 131|135 135 131|135 130 125 125 140 140 137 137 137 145 145 137 125 149 149 154 154 154 154 149 149 149 158 160 160 149 163 163 160 166 164 165|160 160 165|160 160 178 178 173 178 176 176 173 178 178 183 182 182 183 178 186 186 183 186 178 178 192 192 194 194 178 196 194 198 196 200 198 198 203 201 178 206 206 209 209 206 211 206 213 211 206 216 221 220 220 220 216 221 229 222|223|229 222|223|229 223|229 222|223|229 229 229 229 221 237 237 237 237 237 234 237 229 239 243 241 243 243 237 221 248 248 271 250 248 253 253 250 256 256 253 258 256|257|258 256|257|258 256|258 256|257|258 264 264 264 256 268 268 268 264 271 271 271 281 274 281 277 277 274 281 281 281 271 271	Positive_Correlation

[SEP] Ocular and auditory toxicity in hemodialyzed patients receiving @ChemicalSrc$ desferrioxamine @/ChemicalSrc$ . During an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving @ChemicalSrc$ desferrioxamine @/ChemicalSrc$ ( 10 - 40 mg/kg BW/3 times weekly ) for the first time were monitored for detection of audiovisual toxicity . 6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxicity . Moreover , detailed ophthalmologic and audiologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patients . Visual toxicity was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan-type dyschromatopsy , sometimes associated with a loss of visual acuity and pigmentary retinal deposits . Auditory toxicity was characterized by a mid- to high-frequency neurosensorial hearing loss and the lesion was of the cochlear type . @ChemicalSrc$ Desferrioxamine @/ChemicalSrc$ withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3 , and a complete reversal of hearing loss in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3 .

[SEP] Effects of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( Captopril ) on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to intravascular coagulation in the rat . Induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and @ChemicalSrc$ tranexamic acid @/ChemicalSrc$ ( @ChemicalSrc$ AMCA @/ChemicalSrc$ ) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after @DiseaseTgt$ trauma @/DiseaseTgt$ or sepsis in man . Injection of Captopril ( 1 mg/kg ) , an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) , reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model . The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme-blocking agent . The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed , indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein . Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril . The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and @ChemicalSrc$ AMCA @/ChemicalSrc$ alone . It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin ( secondary to an increase in bradykinin ) . Captopril may , by the same mechanism , reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin , thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli , with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced .	1 4 4 1 8 8 8 4 10 8 10 13 16 13 13 1 20 17 20 1 23 23 20 1 48 28 28 25 25 25 32 30 34 25 36 34 36 36|37|38 36|37|38 36|38 36|37|38 42 38|39 38 38|39 42 47 47 34 48 48 51 54 51 51 48 54 55 55 59 57|55 57 57|55 59 59 64 57 48 87 71 69 74 74 71 74 71 78 71 82 82 82 78 84 82 84 69 87 89 87 89 89 89 96 96 96 87 87 100 100 102 102 102 102 102 106 102 108 106 112 112 112 108 102 115 123 117 115 120 120 115 123 123 123 123 123 130 130 130 130 125 132 130 134 132 123 137 151 139 137 142 142 139 145 145 142 142 149 149 137 151 151 153 151 151 156 165 158 156 161 161 156 165 165 165 165 168 168 165 170 168 170 171 171|172 171 171|172 170 165 180 180 180 191 183 191 185 183 188 188 183 191 191 180 195 195 195 191 195 196 199 191 203 203 203 199 205 203 205 199 209 199 211 209 213 199 216 216 213 218 216 213 180 229 229 229 227 227 227 229 229 229 231 229 234 234 231 237 237 234 239 237 242 242 239 244 242 229 247 229 249 247 252 252 249 255 255 249 229 259 259 229 265 262 265 265 265 259 265 268 270 270 273 273 273 265 229	None-CID

[SEP] Effects of an inhibitor of @ChemicalSrc$ angiotensin @/ChemicalSrc$ converting enzyme ( Captopril ) on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to intravascular coagulation in the rat . Induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid ( AMCA ) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or @DiseaseTgt$ sepsis @/DiseaseTgt$ in man . Injection of Captopril ( 1 mg/kg ) , an inhibitor of @ChemicalSrc$ angiotensin @/ChemicalSrc$ converting enzyme ( ACE ) , reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model . The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme-blocking agent . The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed , indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein . Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril . The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone . It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin ( secondary to an increase in bradykinin ) . Captopril may , by the same mechanism , reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin , thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli , with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced .	1 4 4 1 9 9|5 9 9|5 9 4 11 9 11 14 17 14 14 1 21 18 21 1 24 24 21 1 48 30 30 27 27 27 34 32 36 27 38 36 38 41 38 43 41 43 47 47 36 48 48 51 54 51 51 48 54 55 55 59 57 59 59|60 59 59|60 64 57 48 86 69 67 72 72 69 72 69 76 69 81 77|81 81 77|81 81 76 83 81 83 67 86 88 86 88 88 88 95 95 95 86 86 100 100 102 102 102 102 102 106 102 108 106 112 112 112 108 102 115 123 117 115 120 120 115 123 123 123 123 123 130 130 130 130 125 132 130 134 132 123 137 151 139 137 142 142 139 145 145 142 142 149 149 137 151 151 153 151 151 156 165 158 156 161 161 156 165 165 165 165 168 168 165 170 168 170 171 171 170 165 178 178 178 189 181 189 183 181 186 186 181 189 189 178 193 193 193 189 193 194 197 189 201 201 201 197 203 201 203 197 207 197 209 207 211 197 214 214 211 216 214 211 178 227 227 227 225 225 225 227 227 227 229 227 232 232 229 235 235 232 237 235 240 240 237 242 240 227 245 227 247 245 250 250 247 253 253 247 227 257 257 227 263 260 263 263 263 257 263 266 268 268 271 271 271 263 227	None-CID
