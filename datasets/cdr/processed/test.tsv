[SEP] The risk and associated factors of @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$ psychosis in @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$-dependent patients in Malaysia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the risk of lifetime and current @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$-induced psychosis in patients with @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$ dependence. The association between psychiatric co-morbidity and @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$-induced psychosis was also studied. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted concurrently at a teaching hospital and a drug rehabilitation center in Malaysia. Patients with the diagnosis of @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$ based on DSM-IV were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) for @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$-induced psychosis and other Axis I psychiatric disorders. The information on sociodemographic background and drug use history was obtained from interview or medical records. RESULTS: Of 292 subjects, 47.9% of the subjects had a past history of psychotic symptoms and 13.0% of the patients were having current psychotic symptoms. Co-morbid major @DiseaseTgt$ depressive disorder @DiseaseTgt/$ (OR=7.18, 95 CI=2.612-19.708), bipolar disorder (OR=13.807, 95 CI=5.194-36.706), antisocial personality disorder (OR=12.619, 95 CI=6.702-23.759) and heavy @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$ uses were significantly associated with lifetime @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$-induced psychosis after adjusted for other factors.

CONCLUSION: There was a high risk of psychosis in patients with @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$ dependence. It was associated with co-morbid affective disorder, antisocial personality, and heavy @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$ use. It is recommended that all cases of @ChemicalSrc$ methamphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$ dependence should be screened for psychotic symptoms.		None-CID

This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity, indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity.

To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1, we conducted an additional study looking at changes in @DiseaseTgt$ LIDs @DiseaseTgt/$ and PAS-induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral, real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation. Only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1. These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function, occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it, may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of @DiseaseTgt$ abnormal involuntary movements @DiseaseTgt/$.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to explore the function of P2X3 and NK1 receptors antagonists on cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced @DiseaseTgt$ cystitis @DiseaseTgt/$ in rats. METHODS: Sixty female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups. The rats in the control group were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 0.9% saline (4 ml/kg); the rats in the model group were i.p. injected with CYP (150 mg/kg); and the rats in the intervention group were i.p. injected with CYP with subsequently perfusion of bladder with P2X3 and NK1 receptors' antagonists, @ChemicalSrc$ Suramin @ChemicalSrc/$ and GR 82334. Spontaneous pain behaviors following the administration of CYP were observed. Urodynamic parameters, bladder pressure-volume curve, maximum voiding pressure (MVP), and maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), were recorded. Pathological changes in bladder tissue were observed. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors in bladder. RESULTS: Cyclophosphamide treatment increased the spontaneous pain behaviors scores. The incidence of bladder instability during urine storage period of model group was significantly higher than intervention group (X(2) = 7.619, P = 0.007) and control group (X(2) = 13.755, P = 0.000).

[SEP] Pubertal exposure to @ChemicalSrc$ Bisphenol A @ChemicalSrc/$ increases @DiseaseTgt$ anxiety @DiseaseTgt/$-like behavior and decreases acetylcholinesterase activity of hippocampus in adult male mice. The negative effects of @ChemicalSrc$ Bisphenol A @ChemicalSrc/$ (@ChemicalSrc$ BPA @ChemicalSrc/$) on neurodevelopment and behaviors have been well established. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a regulatory enzyme which is involved in @DiseaseTgt$ anxiety @DiseaseTgt/$-like behavior. This study investigated behavioral phenotypes and AChE activity in male mice following @ChemicalSrc$ BPA @ChemicalSrc/$ exposure during puberty. On postnatal day (PND) 35, male mice were exposed to 50mg @ChemicalSrc$ BPA @ChemicalSrc/$/kg diet per day for a period of 35 days. On PND71, a behavioral assay was performed using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the light/dark test. In addition, AChE activity was measured in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum and hippocampus. Results from our behavioral phenotyping indicated that @DiseaseTgt$ anxiety @DiseaseTgt/$-like behavior was increased in mice exposed to @ChemicalSrc$ BPA @ChemicalSrc/$. AChE activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of mice with @ChemicalSrc$ BPA @ChemicalSrc/$ compared to control mice, whereas no difference was found in the prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum. Our findings showed that pubertal @ChemicalSrc$ BPA @ChemicalSrc/$ exposure increased @DiseaseTgt$ anxiety @DiseaseTgt/$-like behavior, which may be associated with decreased AChE activity of the hippocampus in adult male mice. Further studies are necessary to investigate the cholinergic signaling of the hippocampus in PBE induced @DiseaseTgt$ anxiety @DiseaseTgt/$-like behaviors.		CID

The subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (30 mg/kg) into rats twice at an interval of 24 h, for two consecutive days, led to a significant increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, total @ChemicalSrc$ cholesterol @ChemicalSrc/$, triglycerides, free serum fatty acid, cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide levels and a significant decrease in levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in cardiac tissue as compared to the normal control group (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with S. virgaurea extract for 5 weeks at a dose of 250 mg/kg followed by isoproterenol injection significantly prevented the observed alterations. Captopril (50 mg/kg/day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control in this study. The data of the present study suggest that S. virgaurea extract exerts its protective effect by decreasing MDA level and increasing the antioxidant status in isoproterenol-treated rats. The study emphasizes the beneficial action of S. virgaurea extract as a cardioprotective agent.		None-CID

We studied 212 RRMM patients who received @ChemicalSrc$ RD @ChemicalSrc/$ in RW. Objective response (>PR (partial response)) rate was 77.4 % (complete response (CR), 20.2 %). Median time to first and best response was 2 and 5 months, respectively. Median time to CR when @ChemicalSrc$ RD @ChemicalSrc/$ was given as 2nd or >2(nd)-line treatment at 4 and 11 months, respectively. Quality of response was independent of previous lines of therapies or previous exposure to thalidomide or bortezomib. Median duration of response was 34.4 months, and it was higher in patients who received @ChemicalSrc$ RD @ChemicalSrc/$ until progression (not reached versus 19 months, p < 0.001). Improvement of humoral immunity occurred in 60 % of responders (p < 0.001) and in the majority of patients who achieved stable disease. Adverse events were reported in 68.9 % of patients (myelosuppression in 49.4 %) and 12.7 % of patients needed hospitalization. @DiseaseTgt$ Peripheral neuropathy @DiseaseTgt/$ was observed only in 2.5 % of patients and deep vein thrombosis in 5.7 %.

Our study confirms that @ChemicalSrc$ RD @ChemicalSrc/$ is effective and safe in RRMM in the RW; it produces durable responses especially in patients who continue on treatment till progression and improves humoral immunity even in patients with stable disease.

Adverse events were reported in 68.9 % of patients (@DiseaseTgt$ myelosuppression @DiseaseTgt/$ in 49.4 %) and 12.7 % of patients needed hospitalization. Peripheral neuropathy was observed only in 2.5 % of patients and deep vein thrombosis in 5.7 %. Dose reductions were needed in 31 % of patients and permanent discontinuation in 38.9 %. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 16.8 months. Performance status (PS) and initial lenalidomide dose predicted for treatment discontinuation. Extra-medullary relapses occurred in 3.8 % of patients. Our study confirms that RD is effective and safe in RRMM in the RW; it produces durable responses especially in patients who continue on treatment till progression and improves humoral immunity even in patients with stable disease.

[SEP] "Real-world" data on the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and @ChemicalSrc$ dexamethasone @ChemicalSrc/$ in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who were treated according to the standard clinical practice: a study of the Greek Myeloma Study Group. Lenalidomide and @ChemicalSrc$ dexamethasone @ChemicalSrc/$ (@ChemicalSrc$ RD @ChemicalSrc/$) is a standard of care for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), but there is limited published data on its efficacy and safety in the "real world" (RW), according to the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research definition. We studied 212 RRMM patients who received @ChemicalSrc$ RD @ChemicalSrc/$ in RW. Objective response (>PR (partial response)) rate was 77.4 % (complete response (CR), 20.2 %). Median time to first and best response was 2 and 5 months, respectively. Median time to CR when @ChemicalSrc$ RD @ChemicalSrc/$ was given as 2nd or >2(nd)-line treatment at 4 and 11 months, respectively. Quality of response was independent of previous lines of therapies or previous exposure to thalidomide or bortezomib. Median duration of response was 34.4 months, and it was higher in patients who received @ChemicalSrc$ RD @ChemicalSrc/$ until progression (not reached versus 19 months, p < 0.001).

We studied the prevalence and predictors of @ChemicalSrc$ levodopa @ChemicalSrc/$-induced @DiseaseTgt$ dyskinesia @DiseaseTgt/$ among multiethnic Malaysian patients with PD. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 95 patients with PD on uninterrupted @ChemicalSrc$ levodopa @ChemicalSrc/$ therapy for at least 6 months. The instrument used was the UPDRS questionnaires. The predictors of @DiseaseTgt$ dyskinesia @DiseaseTgt/$ were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 65.6 + 8.5 years. The mean onset age was 58.5 + 9.8 years. The median disease duration was 6 (7) years. @DiseaseTgt$ Dyskinesia @DiseaseTgt/$ was present in 44% (n = 42) with median @ChemicalSrc$ levodopa @ChemicalSrc/$ therapy of 3 years.

[SEP] Incidence of @DiseaseTgt$ postoperative delirium @DiseaseTgt/$ is high even in a population without known risk factors. PURPOSE: @DiseaseTgt$ Postoperative delirium @DiseaseTgt/$ is a recognized complication in populations at risk. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of early @DiseaseTgt$ postoperative delirium @DiseaseTgt/$ in a population without known risk factors admitted to the ICU for postoperative monitoring after elective major surgery. The secondary outcome investigated is to identify eventual independent risk factors among demographic data and anesthetic drugs used. METHODS: An observational, prospective study was conducted on a consecutive cohort of patients admitted to our ICU within and for at least 24 h after major surgical procedures. Exclusion criteria were any preexisting predisposing factor for delirium or other potentially confounding neurological dysfunctions. Patients were assessed daily using the confusion assessment method for the ICU scale for 3 days after the surgical procedure. Early @DiseaseTgt$ postoperative delirium @DiseaseTgt/$ incidence risk factors were then assessed through three different multiple regression models. RESULTS: According to the confusion assessment method for the ICU scale, 28 % of patients were diagnosed with early @DiseaseTgt$ postoperative delirium @DiseaseTgt/$.

This depressive-like profile induced by METH was accompanied by a marked depletion of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, indicated by a reduction in the levels of dopamine, DOPAC and @ChemicalSrc$ HVA @ChemicalSrc/$, tyrosine hydroxylase and serotonin, observed at both 3 and 49 days post-administration. In parallel, another neurochemical feature of depression--astroglial dysfunction--was unaffected in the cortex and the striatal levels of the astrocytic protein marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, were only transiently increased at 3 days. These findings demonstrate for the first time that a single high dose of METH induces long-lasting depressive-like behaviour in mice associated with a persistent disruption of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic homoeostasis.

BACKGROUND: The optimal dosing regimens of lipid emulsion, @ChemicalSrc$ epinephrine @ChemicalSrc/$, or both are not yet determined in neonates in cases of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). METHODS: Newborn piglets received levobupivacaine until cardiovascular collapse occurred. Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored for ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, or QRS prolongation. Piglets were then randomly allocated to four groups: control (saline), Intralipid( ) alone, @ChemicalSrc$ epinephrine @ChemicalSrc/$ alone, or a combination of Intralipd plus @ChemicalSrc$ epinephrine @ChemicalSrc/$. Resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min. RESULTS: ROSC was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets. Mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups, but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control. The number of ECG abnormalities was zero in the Intralipid only group, but 14 and 17, respectively, in the @ChemicalSrc$ epinephrine @ChemicalSrc/$ and @ChemicalSrc$ epinephrine @ChemicalSrc/$ plus lipid groups (P<0.05).

METHODS: Newborn piglets received @ChemicalSrc$ levobupivacaine @ChemicalSrc/$ until @DiseaseTgt$ cardiovascular collapse @DiseaseTgt/$ occurred. Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored for ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, or QRS prolongation. Piglets were then randomly allocated to four groups: control (saline), Intralipid( ) alone, epinephrine alone, or a combination of Intralipd plus epinephrine. Resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min. RESULTS: ROSC was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets. Mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups, but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control. The number of ECG abnormalities was zero in the Intralipid only group, but 14 and 17, respectively, in the epinephrine and epinephrine plus lipid groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lipid emulsion with or without epinephrine, or epinephrine alone were equally effective in achieving a return to spontaneous circulation in this model of LAST. Epinephrine alone or in combination with lipid was associated with an increased number of ECG abnormalities compared with lipid emulsion alone.		CID

[SEP] Incidence of @ChemicalSrc$ heparin @ChemicalSrc/$-induced thrombocytopenia type II and postoperative recovery of platelet count in liver graft recipients: a retrospective cohort analysis. BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia in patients with @DiseaseTgt$ end-stage liver disease @DiseaseTgt/$ is a common disorder caused mainly by portal hypertension, low levels of thrombopoetin, and endotoxemia. The impact of immune-mediated @ChemicalSrc$ heparin @ChemicalSrc/$-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) as a cause of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation is not yet understood, with few literature citations reporting contradictory results. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the perioperative course of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation and determine the occurrence of clinical HIT type II. METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full-size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 due to end-stage or malignant liver disease. Preoperative platelet count, postoperative course of platelets, and clinical signs of HIT type II were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 155 (75.6%) of 205 patients had thrombocytopenia before transplantation, significantly influenced by Model of @DiseaseTgt$ End-Stage Liver Disease @DiseaseTgt/$ score and liver cirrhosis. The platelet count exceeded 100,000/uL in most of the patients (n = 193) at a medium of 7 d. Regarding HIT II, there were four (1.95%) patients with a background of HIT type II. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HIT in patients with @DiseaseTgt$ end-stage hepatic failure @DiseaseTgt/$ is, with about 1.95%, rare. For further reduction of HIT type II, the use of intravenous @ChemicalSrc$ heparin @ChemicalSrc/$ should be avoided and the prophylactic anticoagulation should be performed with low-molecular-weight @ChemicalSrc$ heparin @ChemicalSrc/$ after normalization of platelet count.

[SEP] Takotsubo syndrome (or apical ballooning syndrome) secondary to @ChemicalSrc$ Zolmitriptan @ChemicalSrc/$. Takotsubo syndrome (TS), also known as broken heart syndrome, is characterized by left ventricle apical ballooning with elevated cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ie, ST-segment elevation, T wave inversions, and pathologic Q waves). We report a case of 54-year-old woman with medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines, who was admitted to the hospital for substernal @DiseaseTgt$ chest pain @DiseaseTgt/$ and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1/2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 and positive troponin I. Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS. Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took @ChemicalSrc$ zolmitriptan @ChemicalSrc/$ sparingly only when she had migraines. But before this event, she was taking @ChemicalSrc$ zolmitriptan @ChemicalSrc/$ 2-3 times daily for several days because of a persistent migraine headache. She otherwise reported that she is quite active, rides horses, and does show jumping without any limitations in her physical activity. There was no evidence of any recent stress or status migrainosus. Extensive literature search revealed multiple cases of coronary artery vasospasm secondary to @ChemicalSrc$ zolmitriptan @ChemicalSrc/$, but none of the cases were associated with TS.		None-CID

[SEP] Depression, @DiseaseTgt$ impulsiveness @DiseaseTgt/$, sleep, and memory in past and present polydrug users of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy). RATIONALE: Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a worldwide recreational drug of abuse. Unfortunately, the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT-related behaviors; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years, and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances. METHODS: A sample of 997 participants (52 % male) was recruited to four control groups (non-drug (ND), alcohol/nicotine (AN), @ChemicalSrc$ cannabis @ChemicalSrc/$/alcohol/nicotine (@ChemicalSrc$ CAN @ChemicalSrc/$), non-ecstasy polydrug (PD)), and two ecstasy polydrug groups (present (MDMA) and past users (EX-MDMA). Participants completed a drug history questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt @DiseaseTgt$ Impulsiveness @DiseaseTgt/$ Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised which, in total, provided 13 psychometric measures. RESULTS: While the @ChemicalSrc$ CAN @ChemicalSrc/$ and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non-drug controls, the MDMA and EX-MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures. Strikingly, despite prolonged abstinence (mean, 4.98; range, 4-9 years), past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery. Compared with present ecstasy users, the past users showed no change for ten measures, increased impairment for two measures, and improvement on just one measure. CONCLUSIONS: Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression, @DiseaseTgt$ impulsiveness @DiseaseTgt/$, and sleep disturbance, the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern.

Participants completed a drug history questionnaire, Beck @DiseaseTgt$ Depression @DiseaseTgt/$ Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised which, in total, provided 13 psychometric measures. RESULTS: While the @ChemicalSrc$ CAN @ChemicalSrc/$ and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non-drug controls, the MDMA and EX-MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures. Strikingly, despite prolonged abstinence (mean, 4.98; range, 4-9 years), past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery. Compared with present ecstasy users, the past users showed no change for ten measures, increased impairment for two measures, and improvement on just one measure. CONCLUSIONS: Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of @DiseaseTgt$ depression @DiseaseTgt/$, impulsiveness, and sleep disturbance, the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern.

[SEP] Crocin improves lipid dysregulation in subacute @ChemicalSrc$ diazinon @ChemicalSrc/$ exposure through ERK1/2 pathway in rat liver. INTRODUCTION: @ChemicalSrc$ Diazinon @ChemicalSrc/$ Yis one of the most broadly used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture. It has been shown that exposure to @ChemicalSrc$ diazinon @ChemicalSrc/$ may interfere with lipid metabolism. Moreover, the hypolipidemic effect of crocin has been established. Earlier studies revealed the major role of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) expression. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism, ERK and LDLr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute @ChemicalSrc$ diazinon @ChemicalSrc/$. Furthermore ameliorating effect of crocin on @ChemicalSrc$ diazinon @ChemicalSrc/$ induced disturbed cholesterol homeostasis was studied. METHODS: 24 Rats were divided into 4 groups and received following treatments for 4 weeks; Corn oil (control), @ChemicalSrc$ diazinon @ChemicalSrc/$ (15mg/kg per day, orally) and crocin (12.5 and 25mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally) in combination with @ChemicalSrc$ diazinon @ChemicalSrc/$ (15 mg/kg). The levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL in blood of rats were analyzed. Moreover mRNA levels of LDLr and ERK1/2 as well as protein levels of total and activated forms of ERK1/2 in rat liver were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Our data showed that subacute exposure to @ChemicalSrc$ diazinon @ChemicalSrc/$ significantly increased concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL. Moreover @ChemicalSrc$ diazinon @ChemicalSrc/$ decreased ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation and LDLr transcript. Crocin reduced inhibition of ERK activation and @ChemicalSrc$ diazinon @ChemicalSrc/$-induced @DiseaseTgt$ hyperlipemia @DiseaseTgt/$ and increased levels of LDLr transcript.

Following GEM-P, 5-year progression-free survival was 46 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 30-62 %) and 5-year overall survival was 59 % (95 % CI, 43-74 %). Fourteen of 41 patients proceeded directly to autologous transplant. GEM-P is a salvage chemotherapy with relatively high response rates, leading to successful transplantation in appropriate patients, in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL.		CID

[SEP] GEM-P chemotherapy is active in the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a relatively chemosensitive malignancy. However, for those who relapse, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant is the treatment of choice which relies on adequate disease control with salvage chemotherapy. Regimens commonly used often require inpatient administration and can be difficult to deliver due to @DiseaseTgt$ toxicity @DiseaseTgt/$. Gemcitabine and @ChemicalSrc$ cisplatin @ChemicalSrc/$ have activity in HL, non-overlapping @DiseaseTgt$ toxicity @DiseaseTgt/$ with first-line chemotherapeutics, and may be delivered in an outpatient setting. In this retrospective single-centre analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory HL treated with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) day (D)1, D8 and D15; methylprednisolone 1,000 mg D1-5; and @ChemicalSrc$ cisplatin @ChemicalSrc/$ 100 mg/m(2) D15, every 28 days (GEM-P) were included. Demographic, survival, response and @DiseaseTgt$ toxicity @DiseaseTgt/$ data were recorded. Forty-one eligible patients were identified: median age 27. One hundred and twenty-two cycles of GEM-P were administered in total (median 3 cycles; range 1-6). Twenty of 41 (48 %) patients received GEM-P as second-line treatment and 11/41 (27 %) as third-line therapy. Overall response rate (ORR) to GEM-P in the entire cohort was 80 % (complete response (CR) 37 %, partial response 44 %) with 14/15 CR confirmed as a metabolic CR on PET and ORR of 85 % in the 20 second-line patients. The most common grade 3/4 @DiseaseTgt$ toxicities @DiseaseTgt/$ were haematological: neutropenia 54 % and thrombocytopenia 51 %. Median follow-up from the start of GEM-P was 4.5 years.

[SEP] Basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychological distress in recreational @ChemicalSrc$ ecstasy @ChemicalSrc/$ polydrug users. RATIONALE: @ChemicalSrc$ Ecstasy @ChemicalSrc/$ (@ChemicalSrc$ MDMA @ChemicalSrc/$) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with @DiseaseTgt$ psychobiological dysfunction @DiseaseTgt/$. While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long-term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users. OBJECTIVES: The current study is the first to explore the effects of @ChemicalSrc$ ecstasy @ChemicalSrc/$-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period. METHOD: Seventy-six participants (21 nonusers, 29 light @ChemicalSrc$ ecstasy @ChemicalSrc/$-polydrug users, 26 heavy @ChemicalSrc$ ecstasy @ChemicalSrc/$-polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling (on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime). On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor. RESULTS: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers. On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed. On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all @ChemicalSrc$ ecstasy @ChemicalSrc/$-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users. Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day. CONCLUSIONS: The increases in anxiety and depression are in line with previous observations in recreational @ChemicalSrc$ ecstasy @ChemicalSrc/$-polydrug users. Dysregulated diurnal cortisol may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of @ChemicalSrc$ ecstasy @ChemicalSrc/$.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of and possible factors related to @ChemicalSrc$ contrast @ChemicalSrc/$-induced nephropathy (CIN) in hospitalised patients with cancer. METHODS: Ninety adult patients were enrolled. Patients with risk factors for acute renal failure were excluded. Blood samples were examined the day before @ChemicalSrc$ contrast @ChemicalSrc/$-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and serially for 3 days thereafter. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dl or more, or elevation of Cr to 25 % over baseline. Relationships between CIN and possible risk factors were investigated. RESULTS: CIN was detected in 18/90 (20 %) patients. CIN developed in 25.5 % patients who underwent chemotherapy and in 11 % patients who did not (P = 0.1). CIN more frequently developed in patients who had undergone CT within 45 days after the last chemotherapy (P = 0.005); it was also an independent risk factor (P = 0.017). CIN was significantly more after treatment with bevacizumab/irinotecan (P = 0.021) and in patients with @DiseaseTgt$ hypertension @DiseaseTgt/$ (P = 0.044).

OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of and possible factors related to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in hospitalised patients with cancer. METHODS: Ninety adult patients were enrolled. Patients with risk factors for @DiseaseTgt$ acute renal failure @DiseaseTgt/$ were excluded. Blood samples were examined the day before contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and serially for 3 days thereafter. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (@ChemicalSrc$ Cr @ChemicalSrc/$) of 0.5 mg/dl or more, or elevation of @ChemicalSrc$ Cr @ChemicalSrc/$ to 25 % over baseline. Relationships between CIN and possible risk factors were investigated. RESULTS: CIN was detected in 18/90 (20 %) patients. CIN developed in 25.5 % patients who underwent chemotherapy and in 11 % patients who did not (P = 0.1). CIN more frequently developed in patients who had undergone CT within 45 days after the last chemotherapy (P = 0.005); it was also an independent risk factor (P = 0.017).

[SEP] Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion associated with desvenlafaxine. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion associated with desvenlafaxine. CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year old female with hyponatraemia. Her medications included desvenlafaxine, and symptoms included nausea, anxiety and @DiseaseTgt$ confusion @DiseaseTgt/$. The serum @ChemicalSrc$ sodium @ChemicalSrc/$ at this time was 120 mmol/L, serum osmolality was 263 mosmol/kg, urine osmolality 410 mosmol/kg and urine @ChemicalSrc$ sodium @ChemicalSrc/$ 63 mmol/L, consistent with a diagnosis of SIADH. Desvenlafaxine was ceased and fluid restriction implemented. After 4 days the @ChemicalSrc$ sodium @ChemicalSrc/$ increased to 128 mmol/L and fluid restriction was relaxed. During her further 3 weeks inpatient admission the serum @ChemicalSrc$ sodium @ChemicalSrc/$ ranged from 134 to 137 mmol/L during treatment with mirtazapine. DISCUSSION: SIADH has been widely reported with a range of antidepressants. This case report suggests that desvenlafaxine might cause clinically significant hyponatremia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the potential for antidepressants to cause hyponatremia,and take appropriate corrective action where necessary.		None-CID

The clinical and laboratory data of 27 consecutive children who underwent LT from January 2007 to December 2010 in our center were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into seizures group and a non-seizures group. Pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative data were collected. Seizures occurred in four children, an incidence of 14.8%. All exhibited generalized tonic-clonic seizures within the first two wk after LT. Univariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with seizures after pediatric LT included gender, pediatric @DiseaseTgt$ end-stage liver disease @DiseaseTgt/$ score before surgery, Child-Pugh score before surgery, serum total bilirubin after surgery, and trough @ChemicalSrc$ TAC @ChemicalSrc/$ level. Multivariate analysis showed that trough @ChemicalSrc$ TAC @ChemicalSrc/$ level was the only independent risk factor associated with the seizures. All children who experienced seizures survived with good graft function and remained seizure-free without anti-epileptic drugs over a mean follow-up period of 33.7 + 14.6 months. High trough @ChemicalSrc$ TAC @ChemicalSrc/$ level was the predominant factor that contributed to seizures in the early post-operative period after pediatric LT. High PELD and Child-Pugh scores before LT and high post-operative serum Tbil may be contributory risk factors for @ChemicalSrc$ TAC @ChemicalSrc/$-related seizures.		None-CID

Furthermore, microinjection of CCK-8 (0.1 and 1ug, i.c.v.) also significantly augmented hippocampal LTP in saline-treated (1ml/kg, s.c.) rats. Pre-treatment of the CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365,260 (10ug, i.c.v) reversed the effects of CCK-8, but the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718 (10ug, i.c.v) did not. The present results demonstrate that CCK-8 attenuates the effect of @ChemicalSrc$ morphine @ChemicalSrc/$ on hippocampal LTP through CCK2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of CCK-8 on @ChemicalSrc$ morphine @ChemicalSrc/$-induced memory impairment.

[SEP] Glial activation and post-synaptic neurotoxicity: the key events in Streptozotocin (ICV) induced memory impairment in rats. In the present study the role of glial activation and post synaptic toxicity in ICV Streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impaired rats was explored. In experiment set up 1: Memory deficit was found in Morris water maze test on 14-16 days after STZ (ICV; 3mg/Kg) administration. STZ causes increased expression of GFAP, CD11b and TNF-a indicating glial activation and @DiseaseTgt$ neuroinflammation @DiseaseTgt/$. STZ also significantly increased the level of ROS, nitrite, Ca(2+) and reduced the mitochondrial activity in synaptosomal preparation illustrating free radical generation and excitotoxicity. Increased expression and activity of Caspase-3 was also observed in STZ treated rat which specify apoptotic cell death in hippocampus and cortex. STZ treatment showed decrease expression of post synaptic markers CaMKIIa and PSD-95, while, expression of pre synaptic markers (synaptophysin and SNAP-25) remains unaltered indicating selective post synaptic neurotoxicity. Oral treatment with Memantine (10mg/kg) and @ChemicalSrc$ Ibuprofen @ChemicalSrc/$ (50 mg/kg) daily for 13 days attenuated STZ induced glial activation, apoptotic cell death and post synaptic neurotoxicity in rat brain. Further, in experiment set up 2: where memory function was not affected i.e. 7-9 days after STZ treatment. The level of GFAP, CD11b, TNF-a, ROS and nitrite levels were increased. On the other hand, apoptotic marker, synaptic markers, mitochondrial activity and Ca(2+) levels remained unaffected. Collective data indicates that @DiseaseTgt$ neuroinflammatory @DiseaseTgt/$ process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function.

In experiment set up 1: Memory deficit was found in Morris water maze test on 14-16 days after @ChemicalSrc$ STZ @ChemicalSrc/$ (ICV; 3mg/Kg) administration. @ChemicalSrc$ STZ @ChemicalSrc/$ causes increased expression of GFAP, CD11b and TNF-a indicating glial activation and @DiseaseTgt$ neuroinflammation @DiseaseTgt/$. @ChemicalSrc$ STZ @ChemicalSrc/$ also significantly increased the level of ROS, nitrite, Ca(2+) and reduced the mitochondrial activity in synaptosomal preparation illustrating free radical generation and excitotoxicity. Increased expression and activity of Caspase-3 was also observed in @ChemicalSrc$ STZ @ChemicalSrc/$ treated rat which specify apoptotic cell death in hippocampus and cortex. @ChemicalSrc$ STZ @ChemicalSrc/$ treatment showed decrease expression of post synaptic markers CaMKIIa and PSD-95, while, expression of pre synaptic markers (synaptophysin and SNAP-25) remains unaltered indicating selective post synaptic neurotoxicity. Oral treatment with Memantine (10mg/kg) and Ibuprofen (50 mg/kg) daily for 13 days attenuated @ChemicalSrc$ STZ @ChemicalSrc/$ induced glial activation, apoptotic cell death and post synaptic neurotoxicity in rat brain. Further, in experiment set up 2: where memory function was not affected i.e. 7-9 days after @ChemicalSrc$ STZ @ChemicalSrc/$ treatment. The level of GFAP, CD11b, TNF-a, ROS and nitrite levels were increased. On the other hand, apoptotic marker, synaptic markers, mitochondrial activity and Ca(2+) levels remained unaffected. Collective data indicates that @DiseaseTgt$ neuroinflammatory @DiseaseTgt/$ process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function. Present study clearly suggests that glial activation and post synaptic neurotoxicity are the key factors in @ChemicalSrc$ STZ @ChemicalSrc/$ induced memory impairment and neuronal cell death.		CID

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: @ChemicalSrc$ Contrast @ChemicalSrc/$-induced nephropathy (CIN) significantly increases the morbidity and mortality of patients. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the protective effects of isotonic sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate infusion and isotonic sodium chloride infusion with diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, in preventing CIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included patients who were administered 30-60 mL of iodinated @ChemicalSrc$ contrast @ChemicalSrc/$ agent for percutaneous coronary angiography (PCAG), all with creatinine values between 1.1 and 3.1 mg/dL. Patients were divided into three groups and each group had 20 patients. The first group of patients was administered isotonic sodium chloride; the second group was administered a solution that of 5% dextrose and sodium bicarbonate, while the third group was administered isotonic sodium chloride before and after the @ChemicalSrc$ contrast @ChemicalSrc/$ injection. The third group received an additional injection of diltiazem the day before and first 2 days after the @ChemicalSrc$ contrast @ChemicalSrc/$ injection. All of the patients' plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were measured on the second and seventh day after the administration of intravenous @ChemicalSrc$ contrast @ChemicalSrc/$ material. RESULTS: The basal creatinine levels were similar for all three groups (p > 0.05). Among a total of 60 patients included in the study, 16 patients developed @DiseaseTgt$ acute renal failure @DiseaseTgt/$ (@DiseaseTgt$ ARF @DiseaseTgt/$) on the second day after @ChemicalSrc$ contrast @ChemicalSrc/$ material was injected (26.6%).

Among a total of 60 patients included in the study, 16 patients developed acute renal failure (ARF) on the second day after contrast material was injected (26.6%). The number of patients who developed ARF on the second day after the injection in the first group was five (25%), in the second group was six (30%) and the third group was five (25%) (p > 0.05).

[SEP] Pre-treatment of bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular depression using different lipid formulations of propofol. BACKGROUND: Pre-treatment with lipid emulsions has been shown to increase lethal doses of bupivacaine, and the lipid content of propofol may alleviate bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of propofol in intralipid or medialipid emulsions on bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Rats were anaesthetised with @ChemicalSrc$ ketamine @ChemicalSrc/$ and were given 0.5 mg/kg/min propofol in intralipid (Group P), propofol in medialipid (Group L), or saline (Group C) over 20 min. Thereafter, 2 mg/kg/min bupivacaine 0.5% was infused. We recorded time to first @DiseaseTgt$ dysrhythmia @DiseaseTgt/$ occurrence, respective times to 25% and 50% reduction of the heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure, and time to asystole and total amount of bupivacaine consumption. Blood and tissue samples were collected following asystole. RESULTS: The time to first @DiseaseTgt$ dysrhythmia @DiseaseTgt/$ occurrence, time to 25% and 50% reductions in HR, and time to asystole were longer in Group P than the other groups. The cumulative bupivacaine dose given at those time points was higher in Group P. Plasma bupivacaine levels were significantly lower in Group P than in Group C. Bupivacaine levels in the brain and heart were significantly lower in Group P and Group L than in Group C. CONCLUSION: We conclude that pre-treatment with propofol in intralipid, compared with propofol in medialipid or saline, delayed the onset of bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxic effects as well as reduced plasma bupivacaine levels. Further studies are needed to explore tissue bupivacaine levels of propofol in medialipid and adapt these results to clinical practice.		None-CID

METHODS: Rats were anaesthetised with ketamine and were given 0.5 mg/kg/min @ChemicalSrc$ propofol @ChemicalSrc/$ in intralipid (Group P), @ChemicalSrc$ propofol @ChemicalSrc/$ in medialipid (Group L), or saline (Group C) over 20 min. Thereafter, 2 mg/kg/min bupivacaine 0.5% was infused. We recorded time to first dysrhythmia occurrence, respective times to 25% and 50% reduction of the heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure, and time to asystole and total amount of bupivacaine consumption. Blood and tissue samples were collected following asystole. RESULTS: The time to first dysrhythmia occurrence, time to 25% and 50% reductions in HR, and time to asystole were longer in Group P than the other groups. The cumulative bupivacaine dose given at those time points was higher in Group P. Plasma bupivacaine levels were significantly lower in Group P than in Group C. Bupivacaine levels in the brain and heart were significantly lower in Group P and Group L than in Group C. CONCLUSION: We conclude that pre-treatment with @ChemicalSrc$ propofol @ChemicalSrc/$ in intralipid, compared with @ChemicalSrc$ propofol @ChemicalSrc/$ in medialipid or saline, delayed the onset of bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxic effects as well as reduced plasma bupivacaine levels. Further studies are needed to explore tissue bupivacaine levels of @ChemicalSrc$ propofol @ChemicalSrc/$ in medialipid and adapt these results to clinical practice.		None-CID
