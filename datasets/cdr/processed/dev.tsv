A time course was established for the change in tissue mass, RNA and DNA content, as well as hydroxyproline content. Heart weight increased 44% after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3.4 days. Ventricular RNA content was elevated 26% after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therapy. The half time for RNA accumulation was 2.0 days. The total content of hydroxyproline remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46% after 4 days of therapy. Ventricular DNA content was unchanged during the early stage (1-4 days) of hypertrophic growth but increased to a new steady-state level 19% above the controls after 8 days of treatment. Intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed hypertrophy. However, dP/dt in the @ChemicalSrc$ ISO @ChemicalSrc/$-treated hearts was slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated. These data indicate that the adaptive response to @ChemicalSrc$ ISO @ChemicalSrc/$ shows an early hypertrophic phase (1-4 days) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA.

Flumazenil (mean dose, 0.76 mg) or placebo (mean dose, 8.9 ml) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients, respectively, who had been given diazepam in conjunction with an opioid (fentanyl, meperidine, or @ChemicalSrc$ morphine @ChemicalSrc/$) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures. The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with flumazenil and 64 patients given placebo. After 5 minutes, 80/115 (70%) flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 21/63 (33%) placebo-treated patients, were completely awake and alert, as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. Ninety-five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5-minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180-minute assessment period. Flumazenil-treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger-to-Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5-minute assessment. Flumazenil was well tolerated, with no serious adverse effects reported. Thirty-nine (30%) of flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 17 (25%) of placebo-treated patients had one or more drug-related adverse experiences. The most common adverse effects were @DiseaseTgt$ nausea @DiseaseTgt/$ and vomiting in the flumazenil group and @DiseaseTgt$ nausea @DiseaseTgt/$ and injection-site pain in the placebo group. Flumazenil was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by diazepam in the presence of opioids.		None-CID

The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with @ChemicalSrc$ flumazenil @ChemicalSrc/$ and 64 patients given placebo. After 5 minutes, 80/115 (70%) @ChemicalSrc$ flumazenil @ChemicalSrc/$-treated patients, compared with 21/63 (33%) placebo-treated patients, were completely awake and alert, as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. Ninety-five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5-minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180-minute assessment period. @ChemicalSrc$ Flumazenil @ChemicalSrc/$-treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger-to-Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5-minute assessment. @ChemicalSrc$ Flumazenil @ChemicalSrc/$ was well tolerated, with no serious adverse effects reported. Thirty-nine (30%) of @ChemicalSrc$ flumazenil @ChemicalSrc/$-treated patients, compared with 17 (25%) of placebo-treated patients had one or more drug-related adverse experiences. The most common adverse effects were nausea and @DiseaseTgt$ vomiting @DiseaseTgt/$ in the @ChemicalSrc$ flumazenil @ChemicalSrc/$ group and nausea and injection-site pain in the placebo group. @ChemicalSrc$ Flumazenil @ChemicalSrc/$ was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by diazepam in the presence of opioids.

RESULTS: We included 641 patients.

In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of @DiseaseTgt$ schizophrenia @DiseaseTgt/$, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis. METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. Moreover, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced psychosis patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced psychosis in the Japanese population.		None-CID

BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. The serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and @ChemicalSrc$ d-amphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by @ChemicalSrc$ d-amphetamine @ChemicalSrc/$ or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of @DiseaseTgt$ paranoid type schizophrenia @DiseaseTgt/$. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis. METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. Moreover, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced psychosis patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced psychosis in the Japanese population.		None-CID

[SEP] Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on @ChemicalSrc$ bupropion hydrochloride @ChemicalSrc/$-induced @DiseaseTgt$ seizures @DiseaseTgt/$ in mice. BACKGROUND: It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of @ChemicalSrc$ bupropion @ChemicalSrc/$-induced @DiseaseTgt$ seizures @DiseaseTgt/$. This is important, since different controlled release formulations of @ChemicalSrc$ bupropion @ChemicalSrc/$ release the active drug at different rates. METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of @ChemicalSrc$ bupropion HCl @ChemicalSrc/$ 120 mg/kg, a known @DiseaseTgt$ convulsive @DiseaseTgt/$ dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of @ChemicalSrc$ bupropion @ChemicalSrc/$-induced @DiseaseTgt$ convulsions @DiseaseTgt/$ in the Swiss albino mice. A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to @ChemicalSrc$ bupropion HCl @ChemicalSrc/$ 120 mg/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (IP) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group). @ChemicalSrc$ Bupropion HCl @ChemicalSrc/$ was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min. The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the @DiseaseTgt$ convulsions @DiseaseTgt/$ or absence of @DiseaseTgt$ convulsions @DiseaseTgt/$ were recorded. RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of @ChemicalSrc$ bupropion HCl @ChemicalSrc/$ 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced @DiseaseTgt$ convulsions @DiseaseTgt/$ in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1. Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of @ChemicalSrc$ bupropion HCl @ChemicalSrc/$ 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of @DiseaseTgt$ convulsions @DiseaseTgt/$ at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection. Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of @DiseaseTgt$ convulsions @DiseaseTgt/$ to 99.8% reduction at 240 min. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and @DiseaseTgt$ convulsive @DiseaseTgt/$ dose of @ChemicalSrc$ bupropion @ChemicalSrc/$ and the risk of @DiseaseTgt$ convulsions @DiseaseTgt/$ in a prospective study is novel.

Basal activity, latent period and the @ChemicalSrc$ penicillin @ChemicalSrc/$-induced @DiseaseTgt$ epileptiform activity @DiseaseTgt/$ periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis. Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2) and gamma (1 and 2) bands. Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the @DiseaseTgt$ epileptiform activity @DiseaseTgt/$ and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and @DiseaseTgt$ epileptiform activity @DiseaseTgt/$).

Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i.p. @ChemicalSrc$ urethane @ChemicalSrc/$ and connected to an electrocorticogram setup. After a short period of basal activity recording, @DiseaseTgt$ epileptic @DiseaseTgt/$ focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl penicillin-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded. Basal activity, latent period and the penicillin-induced @DiseaseTgt$ epileptiform activity @DiseaseTgt/$ periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis. Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2) and gamma (1 and 2) bands. Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the @DiseaseTgt$ epileptiform activity @DiseaseTgt/$ and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and @DiseaseTgt$ epileptiform activity @DiseaseTgt/$). Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental @DiseaseTgt$ epilepsies @DiseaseTgt/$.

[SEP] High dose @ChemicalSrc$ dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI. OBJECTIVE: This large-scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of @ChemicalSrc$ dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$. AIM: To determine the hemodynamic responses, efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose @ChemicalSrc$ dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. BACKGROUND: @ChemicalSrc$ Dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies. Over time, an effective protocol utilizing high dose @ChemicalSrc$ dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ as the sole sedative agent has evolved. METHODS/MATERIALS: As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process, data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed. Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received @ChemicalSrc$ dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007. RESULTS: Since 2005, the 10-min loading dose of our @ChemicalSrc$ dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg.kg(-1), and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1.5 to 2 microg.kg(-1).h(-1). The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation (able to complete the imaging study) when using @ChemicalSrc$ dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ alone from 91.8% to 97.6% (P = 0.009), reducing the requirement for adjuvant pentobarbital in the event of sedation failure with @ChemicalSrc$ dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min (P < 0.001). Although @ChemicalSrc$ dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ sedation was associated with a 16% incidence of @DiseaseTgt$ bradycardia @DiseaseTgt/$, all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20% of age-adjusted normal range and oxygen saturations were 95% or higher. CONCLUSION: @ChemicalSrc$ Dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ in high doses provides adequate sedation for pediatric MRI studies. While use of high dose @ChemicalSrc$ dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ is associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure outside the established 'awake' norms, this deviation is generally within 20% of norms, and is not associated with adverse sequelae. @ChemicalSrc$ Dexmedetomidine @ChemicalSrc/$ is useful as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI.

[SEP] Assessment of the onset and persistence of amnesia during procedural sedation with @ChemicalSrc$ propofol @ChemicalSrc/$. OBJECTIVES: To assess patients' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with @ChemicalSrc$ propofol @ChemicalSrc/$, and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. METHODS: This was a prospective, single-intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with @ChemicalSrc$ propofol @ChemicalSrc/$ between December 28, 2002, and October 31, 2003. BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status. At 1-minute intervals during the procedural sedation, until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure, a word from a standardized list was read aloud, and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator. The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient's ability to repeat the word were recorded. After the procedure, the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall, and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed. RESULTS: Seventy-five consenting patients were enrolled; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation. No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations. The mean (+/-standard deviation) time of data collection was 16.4 minutes (+/-7.1; range 5 to 34 minutes). The mean initial (preprocedure) BIS score was 97.1 (+/-2.3; range 92 to 99). The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66.9 (+/-14.4; range 33 to 91). The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77.1 (95% CI = 74.3 to 80.0). The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the inability to repeat words was 81.5 (95% CI = 78.1 to 84.8). The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96.7 (+/-2.4; range 84 to 98). The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91.2 (95% CI = 88.1 to 94.3). All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol. The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91.5 (+/-11.1; range 79 to 98), and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90. CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words. Furthermore, patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation, suggestive of @DiseaseTgt$ retrograde amnesia @DiseaseTgt/$.

[SEP] Expression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis in vivo. @ChemicalSrc$ Doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ is an anti-@DiseaseTgt$ tumor @DiseaseTgt/$ agent that represses cardiac-specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis. @ChemicalSrc$ Doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ depletes cardiac p300, a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes. However, the role of p300 in protection against @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$-induced apoptosis is unknown. Transgenic mice overexpressing p300 in the heart and wild-type mice were subjected to @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ treatment. Compared with wild-type mice, transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha-sarcomeric actin. @ChemicalSrc$ Doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild-type mice but not in transgenic mice. Expression of p300 increased the cardiac level of bcl-2 and mdm-2, but not that of p53 or other members of the bcl-2 family. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$-induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute heart failure in adult mice in vivo.

[SEP] Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ nephrosis. BACKGROUND: @ChemicalSrc$ Doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ induces a self-perpetuating nephropathy characterized by early glomerular and late-onset tubular lesions in rats. We investigated the potential role of @DiseaseTgt$ mitochondrial injury @DiseaseTgt/$ in the onset of these lesions. METHODS: Rats were treated with intravenous @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ (1 mg kg(-1) week(-1)) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ('short-term') or 30 weeks ('long-term') following the last dose. Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia. All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age. Glomerular and tubular injury was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components. Finally, we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as superoxide production and the 4834 base pair 'common' mtDNA deletion. RESULTS: The 'long-term' group had significant glomerular and tubular lesions, depressed activities of mtDNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) and increased citrate synthase activity. In addition, expression of the mtDNA-encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased. In 'short-term' rats, there were fewer tubular lesions, but similar numbers of glomerular lesions activity. Among all animals, glomerular and tubular injury were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels, mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain subunit COX-I. Injury was positively correlated with superoxide production and the activities of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes. Kidneys from the 'long-term' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in 'short-term' animals and these were not observed in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain function and induction of superoxide in @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$-induced renal lesions.

[SEP] Amphotericin B-induced seizures in a patient with AIDS. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of multiple episodes of seizure activity in an AIDS patent following amphotericin B infusion. CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man experienced recurrent grand mal seizures during intravenous infusion of amphotericin B, then petit mal seizures as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time. The patients concurrent medications included didanosine, hydroxyzine, promethazine, hydrocortisone, and prochlorperazine. Despite administration of phenytoin and @ChemicalSrc$ lorazepam @ChemicalSrc/$, the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration. DISCUSSION: AIDS and @DiseaseTgt$ cryptococcal meningitis @DiseaseTgt/$, both of which the patient had, can potentially cause seizures. The patient had a history of alcohol abuse; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures. Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures. However, these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out. The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient.

Despite administration of @ChemicalSrc$ phenytoin @ChemicalSrc/$ and lorazepam, the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration. DISCUSSION: @DiseaseTgt$ AIDS @DiseaseTgt/$ and cryptococcal meningitis, both of which the patient had, can potentially cause seizures. The patient had a history of alcohol abuse; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures. Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures. However, these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out. The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this @DiseaseTgt$ AIDS @DiseaseTgt/$ patient. CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B seems to be the probable cause of the seizures. To date, only three cases of seizures associated with amphotericin B have been reported in the literature, but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect.

CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man experienced recurrent @DiseaseTgt$ grand mal seizures @DiseaseTgt/$ during intravenous infusion of amphotericin B, then petit mal seizures as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time. The patients concurrent medications included didanosine, hydroxyzine, promethazine, @ChemicalSrc$ hydrocortisone @ChemicalSrc/$, and prochlorperazine. Despite administration of phenytoin and lorazepam, the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration. DISCUSSION: AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis, both of which the patient had, can potentially cause seizures. The patient had a history of alcohol abuse; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures. Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures. However, these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out. The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient. CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B seems to be the probable cause of the seizures. To date, only three cases of seizures associated with amphotericin B have been reported in the literature, but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect.

[SEP] Therapeutic drug monitoring of @ChemicalSrc$ tobramycin @ChemicalSrc/$: once-daily versus twice-daily dosage schedules. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of @ChemicalSrc$ tobramicyn @ChemicalSrc/$ on steady-state serum concentrations and @DiseaseTgt$ toxicity @DiseaseTgt/$. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. @ChemicalSrc$ tobramycin @ChemicalSrc/$ (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups. Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of @ChemicalSrc$ tobramycin @ChemicalSrc/$ and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily. @ChemicalSrc$ Tobramycin @ChemicalSrc/$ serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before, during and immediately after treatment. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, body weight and renal function. No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose, duration of treatment, or cumulative dose. Trough concentrations were < 2 g/ml in the two groups (100%). Peak concentrations were > 6 microg/ml in 100% of the OD group and in 67% of the TD group (P< 0.01). Mean peak concentrations were markedly different: 11.00+/-2.89 microg/ml in OD vs. 6.53+/-1.45 microg/ml in TD (P< 0.01). The pharmacokinetics parameters were: Ke, (0.15+/-0.03/h in OD vs. 0.24+/-0.06/h in TD), t1/2, (4.95+/-1.41 h in OD vs. 3.07+/-0.71 h in TD), Vd (0.35+/-0.11 l/kg in OD vs. 0.33+/-0.09 l/kg in TD), Cl (0.86+/-0.29 ml/min/kg in OD vs. 1.28+/-0.33 ml/min/kg in TD). Increased serum creatinine was observed in 73% of patients in OD versus 57% of patients in TD, without evidence of nephrotoxicity. In TD group, three patients developed decreased auditory function, of which one presented with an auditory loss of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented decreased auditory function. CONCLUSION: This small study suggests that a once-daily dosing regimen of @ChemicalSrc$ tobramycin @ChemicalSrc/$ is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice-daily regimen. Using a single-dose therapy, peak concentration determination is not necessary, only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg/ml.		None-CID

In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg). The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing. Animals which received over six courses of @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM-5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations. To examine a possibly deteriorating @DiseaseTgt$ cardiotoxic @DiseaseTgt/$ effect of SM-5887, low-grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ (1.5 mg/kg). Nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. The low-grade @DiseaseTgt$ cardiotoxic @DiseaseTgt/$ changes were enhanced by the additional @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$ treatment. On the contrary, the SM-5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy. In conclusion, SM-5887 does not have any potential of chronic @DiseaseTgt$ cardiotoxicity @DiseaseTgt/$ and deteriorating effect on @ChemicalSrc$ doxorubicin @ChemicalSrc/$-induced @DiseaseTgt$ cardiotoxicity @DiseaseTgt/$ in dogs.

[SEP] Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced Parkinson's disease. BACKGROUND: Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short-term follow-up. METHODS: Forty patients with Parkinson's disease underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ("off" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ("on" period). All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years. RESULTS: The percent improvements at six months were as follows: off-period score for overall motor function, 28 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off-period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on-period score for contralateral @DiseaseTgt$ dyskinesias @DiseaseTgt/$, 82 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on-period score for ipsilateral @DiseaseTgt$ dyskinesias @DiseaseTgt/$, 44 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent). The improvements in @DiseaseTgt$ dyskinesias @DiseaseTgt/$ and the total scores for off-period parkinsonism, contralateral bradykinesia, and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years. The improvement in ipsilateral @DiseaseTgt$ dyskinesias @DiseaseTgt/$ was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months. Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery. The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication. CONCLUSIONS: In late-stage Parkinson's disease, pallidotomy significantly reduces @ChemicalSrc$ levodopa @ChemicalSrc/$-induced @DiseaseTgt$ dyskinesias @DiseaseTgt/$ and off-period disability. Much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year. The on-period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy.		CID

[SEP] Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Also relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included @ChemicalSrc$ oestrogens @ChemicalSrc/$, with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of @DiseaseTgt$ venous thrombo-embolism @DiseaseTgt/$ or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease. Long-term @ChemicalSrc$ oestrogen @ChemicalSrc/$-only HT significantly increased the risk of @DiseaseTgt$ venous thrombo-embolism @DiseaseTgt/$, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and (for combined HT) colon cancer, with long-term use. Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of @DiseaseTgt$ venous thrombo-embolism @DiseaseTgt/$.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking @ChemicalSrc$ oestrogen @ChemicalSrc/$-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for @DiseaseTgt$ venous thrombo-embolism @DiseaseTgt/$ in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.		CID

However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.		None-CID

BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Also relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included oestrogens, with or without @ChemicalSrc$ progestogens @ChemicalSrc/$, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease. Long-term oestrogen-only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and (for combined HT) @DiseaseTgt$ colon cancer @DiseaseTgt/$, with long-term use. Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Also relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included @ChemicalSrc$ oestrogens @ChemicalSrc/$, with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), @DiseaseTgt$ breast cancer @DiseaseTgt/$ and gallbladder disease. Long-term @ChemicalSrc$ oestrogen @ChemicalSrc/$-only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of @DiseaseTgt$ breast cancer @DiseaseTgt/$. The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and (for combined HT) colon cancer, with long-term use. Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking @ChemicalSrc$ oestrogen @ChemicalSrc/$-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo-embolism in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease. We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.		None-CID

AIM: Widespread use of @ChemicalSrc$ mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ to reduce @DiseaseTgt$ brain edema @DiseaseTgt/$ and lower elevated ICP in brain tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so-called rebound phenomenon. Leakage of @ChemicalSrc$ mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound . This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals. As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of @ChemicalSrc$ mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients. METHODS: @ChemicalSrc$ Mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ (18% solution; 1 g/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had malignant glioma, seven brain metastases and four meningioma) about 30 minutes before craniotomy. During resection, a sample of the surrounding edematous white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample. @ChemicalSrc$ Mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al. RESULTS: In most glioma patients, @ChemicalSrc$ mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of @ChemicalSrc$ mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that even after a single bolus, @ChemicalSrc$ mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ may leak through the altered BBB near gliomas, reversing the initial plasma-to-blood osmotic gradient, aggravating peritumoral edema and promoting rebound of ICP.

METHODS: @ChemicalSrc$ Mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ (18% solution; 1 g/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had malignant glioma, seven brain @DiseaseTgt$ metastases @DiseaseTgt/$ and four meningioma) about 30 minutes before craniotomy. During resection, a sample of the surrounding edematous white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample. @ChemicalSrc$ Mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al. RESULTS: In most glioma patients, @ChemicalSrc$ mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). In meningioma and @DiseaseTgt$ metastases @DiseaseTgt/$ patients plasma concentrations of @ChemicalSrc$ mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that even after a single bolus, @ChemicalSrc$ mannitol @ChemicalSrc/$ may leak through the altered BBB near gliomas, reversing the initial plasma-to-blood osmotic gradient, aggravating peritumoral edema and promoting rebound of ICP.

[SEP] Can lidocaine reduce succinylcholine induced @DiseaseTgt$ postoperative myalgia @DiseaseTgt/$? This study was undertaken to determine the effect of lidocaine pretreatment on reduction of succinylcholine-induced myalgia in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery. One hundred and thirty-five patients were assigned to one of three groups in a prospective, double blind, randomized manner. Group PS, the control group, received normal saline and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group LS, lidocaine 1.5 mg x kg(-1) and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group PR, normal saline and @ChemicalSrc$ rocuronium @ChemicalSrc/$ 0.6 mg x kg(-1). Morphine 0.1 mg x kg(-1) iv was given for premedication and all patients were monitored with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, ECG and pulse oximetry. Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg(-1) thiopental iv. followed by succinylcholine (Group PS, LS) or @ChemicalSrc$ rocuronium @ChemicalSrc/$ (Group PR) for tracheal intubation. Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered. The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions. Twenty-four hours later, any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management. The results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in Group PS (p < 0.001). At 24 h, the incidence of myalgia was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR (p < 0.05). A correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation. The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups. In conclusion, where succinylcholine is used, lidocaine is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of @DiseaseTgt$ postoperative myalgia @DiseaseTgt/$.		None-CID
