HPRD50_d28_1	Gene	Gene	T5	T9	True	0	What is [HPRD50] ? [SEP] We report that MSH2 (MutS homolog 2) protein interacts with the ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) kinase to form a signaling module and regulate the phosphorylation of Chk1 and SMC1 (structure maintenance of chromosome 1) We found that phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR also requires checkpoint proteins @GeneSrc$ and replication protein A In contrast, phosphorylation of SMC1 by ATR is independent of Rad17 and replication protein A, suggesting that the signaling pathway leading to SMC1 phosphorylation is distinct from that mediated by the checkpoint proteins In addition, both @GeneTgt$ and Rad17 are required for the activation of the S-phase checkpoint to suppress DNA synthesis in response to MNNG, and phosphorylation of SMC1 is required for cellular survival.

[SEP] The protein pVHL functions in a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Hif1 alpha for proteasomal degradation during normoxia We establish that pVHL binds to Tat-binding protein-1 (TBP-1), a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and Hif1 alpha in vivo Overexpression of TBP-1 promotes degradation of Hif1 alpha in a pVHL-dependent manner that requires the ATPase domain of TBP-1 Blockade of @GeneSrc$ expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) causes prolonged degradation kinetics of @GeneTgt$ Several distinct mutations in exon 2 of VHL disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP-1 A pVHL mutant containing a P154L substitution coimmunoprecipitates with Hif1 alpha, but not TBP-1, and does not promote degradation of Hif1 alpha Thus , the ability of pVHL to degrade Hif1 alpha depends in part on its interaction with TBP-1 and suggests a new mechanism for Hif1 alpha stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors.
