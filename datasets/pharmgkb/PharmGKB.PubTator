7633940|t|C1840-T mutation in the human skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene: frequency in northern German families susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and the relationship to in vitro contracture response.
7633940|a|In swine, a point mutation in the ryanodine receptor gene can account for all cases of malignant hyperthermia (MH). The frequency of a corresponding mutation in humans (C1840-T) and its relationship to the in vitro contracture profile is unknown. We screened 192 patients from 28 unrelated northern German families for the C1840-T mutation in the human ryanodine receptor gene and tested for MH susceptibility using the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) according to the European MH Protocol. In our patients 106 revealed MH susceptible (MHS), 56 MH nonsusceptible and 30 MH equivocal status following IVCT. In each family one or two individuals had developed clinical signs of MH or a MH crisis. All of these patients were classified MHS. The C1840-T mutation was found in 2 of 28 families (7.1%). All eight individuals of the two families characterized by this mutation revealed MHS status following IVCT. The thresholds for halothane- and caffeine-induced contractures as well as the contracture profiles following cumulative (0.4-10.0 mumol/l every 3 min) and bolus (10 mumol/l) administration of ryanodine were found to be similar in MHS patients with and without the C1840-T mutation. In conclusion, the C1840-T mutation in the human ryanodine receptor gene is a rare abnormality in MHS families. Similar contracture profiles in the presence and absence of this mutation might imply no major functional role with respect to the contracture response. At present, molecular genetic analysis cannot replace IVCT to discover MH susceptibility in humans.

8602662|t|Comparison of the segregation of the RYR1 C1840T mutation with segregation of the caffeine/halothane contracture test results for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in a large Manitoba Mennonite family.
8602662|a|BACKGROUND: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an important cause of anesthesia-induced death. Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is diagnosed using the in vitro caffeine/halothane contracture test (CHCT) in fresh muscle biopsy specimens. The CHCT test is highly invasive, expensive, and lacks 100% specificity. Genetic and biochemical evidence provide strong support for the view that the substitution of cysteine for arginine 614 (Arg614Cys) in the human ryanodine receptor gene is one of several mutations that are likely to cause human MH. DNA testing was compared with CHCT as a means of predicting MH susceptibility in a large MH family in which the Arg614Cys mutation was detected. METHODS: A comparison of CHCT and DNA-based diagnosis was conducted in a large Manitoba Mennonite MH kindred identified by an index patient who died at age 45 yr of an MH crisis after general anesthesia. The presence of the Arg614Cys mutation was detected through a combination of polymerase chain reaction and restriction endonuclease digestion. Blood samples for DNA analysis were obtained from 68 family members, including 19 who had undergone muscle biopsies and 1 who had a documented crisis but did not undergo biopsy. Family members were classified as MH-susceptible or MH-normal on the basis of the CHCT. RESULTS: Twenty-two persons were found to be heterozygous for the Arg614Cys mutation. Five of these persons had prior positive CHCT results and one had an MH crisis but did not undergo biopsy. On DNA testing, 44 persons were found to be homozygous for the normal allele. Of these, ten had been classified as MH-normal and five as MH-susceptible on the basis of the CHCT. On reevaluation of the data obtained in our earlier CHCT diagnoses, we found that the condition of the muscle was poor, with no twitch, for three of five individuals homozygous for the normal allele but originally classified as MH-susceptible and for one who was homozygous for the normal allele and originally classified as MH-normal. Caffeine/halothane contracture test results for these four persons were considered invalid. The twitch response was good for the two remaining persons who were homozygous for the normal allele but classified as MH- susceptible, because contracture was observed with appropriately low levels of both caffeine and halothane. CONCLUSIONS: An absolute correlation between DNA test results and CHCT assignment could not be made in this kindred. Possible explanations for discordance are that the Arg614Cys mutation is not linked to MH, that a second MH mutation is segregating in the family, or that there are errors in the CHCT. Because there is strong evidence supporting the causal nature of the Arg614Cys mutation, the discordant persons are not closely related within the pedigree as they would be if a second MH mutation were segregating, and the CHCT is not 100% accurate, we propose that the observed discordance between DNA test results and CHCT assignment in this kindred results from two false-positive diagnoses by the CHCT.

8828983|t|RYR mutation G1021A (Gly341Arg) is not frequent in Danish and Swedish families with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.
8828983|a|Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder. Susceptibility to MH (MHS) is presumed to be inherited in an autosomal dominant way. MH crises are triggered by halogenated inhalational anaesthetics and suxamethonium, and may be lethal if not treated early and adequately. Until now, eight mutations in the RYR1 gene have been described as causes of MHS phenotype in various MH families. The mutation RYR1 G1021A (Gly341Arg) has been reported to account for approximately 10% of Caucasian MHS cases. However, in our study this mutation was discovered in only 1 out of 89 Scandinavian families, indicating that this mutation may be the cause of MHS in only about 1% of MHS families in those populations. The mutation may have been brought to Scandinavia by an immigrant.

8952600|t|Influence of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene polymorphism on the effects of perindopril and nitrendipine on arterial stiffness in hypertensive individuals.
8952600|a|Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve arterial stiffness independently of blood pressure reduction. Since we have recently shown that in hypertensive individuals the A1166C polymorphism of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) is an independent determinant of aortic stiffness, we designed the present study to assess the influence of this polymorphism on the changes of aortic stiffness after chronic treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril and the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine. Forty perindopril- and 42 nitrendipine-treated hypertensive individuals were studied. We evaluated aortic stiffness by measuring the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Carriers of the AT1-RC allele showed higher baseline values of pulse wave velocity than AA homozygotes (P &lt; .05). In the perindopril group, a threefold greater reduction in pulse wave velocity was observed in carriers of the C allele than in AA homozygotes (-2.85 +/- 0.62 versus -0.94 +/- 0.32 m/s, respectively; P &lt; .001), whereas in the nitrendipine group, pulse wave velocity decreased only in AA homozygotes and not in AT1-R C carriers (-1.38 +/- 0.35 versus +0.04 +/- 0.60 m/s, respectively; P &lt; .01). These results indicate that according to the AT1-R A1166C genotype, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker affect pulse wave velocity in opposite ways. Since some evidence shows that increased pulse wave velocity may enhance cardiovascular risk, it might be useful for physicians to consider the AT1-R genotype when prescribing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker to a hypertensive individual.

10352931|t|A case of discordance between genotype and phenotype in a malignant hyperthermia family.
10352931|a|Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an inherited autosomal dominant pharmacogenetic disorder and is the major cause of anaesthesia-induced death. Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is usually diagnosed by the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) performed on fresh muscle biopsies exposed to caffeine and halothane, respectively. Around 50% of affected families are linked to the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene. The human RYR1 gene maps to chromosome 19q13.1 and encodes a protein that associates as a homotetramer and acts as a calcium-release channel from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. To date, 17 mutations have been identified in the coding region of the RYR1 gene and appear to be associated to the MH-susceptible phenotype. Here we describe a rare case of discordance between genotype (characterised by the presence of the Arg614Cys mutation in the RYR1 gene) and MH-normal typed phenotype. Although the IVCT remains a very reliable procedure for the assessment of MH status, genetic data can provide in some cases an additional aid to clinical diagnosis.

10888602|t|A novel ryanodine receptor mutation and genotype-phenotype correlation in a large malignant hyperthermia New Zealand Maori pedigree.
10888602|a|Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder that predisposes to a sometimes fatal hypermetabolic reaction to halogenated anaesthetics. MH is considered to originate from abnormal regulation of skeletal muscle Ca(2+) release. Current diagnosis of MH susceptibility (MHS) relies on in vitro contracture testing (IVCT) of skeletal muscle. The ryanodine receptor (RYR1) encoding the major Ca(2+) release channel in the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum has been shown to be mutated in a number of MH pedigrees. The large Maori pedigree reported here is the largest MHS pedigree investigated to date and comprises five probands who experienced clinical episodes of MH and 130 members diagnosed by the IVCT. Sequencing of the 15 117 bp RYR1 cDNA in a MHS individual from this pedigree identified a novel C14477T transition that results in a Thr4826 to Ile substitution in the C-terminal region/transmembrane loop of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor. This is the first mutation in the RyR1 C-terminal region associated solely with MHS. Although linkage analysis showed strong linkage (max LOD, 11.103 at theta = 0.133) between the mutation and MHS in the pedigree using the standardized European IVCT phenotyping protocol, 22 MHS recombinants were observed. The relationship between the IVCT response and genotype was explored and showed that as IVCT diagnostic cut-off points were made increasingly stringent, the number of MHS discordants decreased with complete concordance between the presence or absence of the C14477T mutation and MHS and MH normal phenotypes, respectively, using a cut-off of 1.2 g tension at 2.0 mM caffeine and 1.8 g tension at 2.0% halothane. Many MHS pedigrees investigated have been excluded from linkage to the RYR1 gene on the basis of a small number of recombinants; however, the linkage analysis reported here suggests that other recombinant families excluded from linkage to the RYR1 gene may actually demonstrate linkage as the number of members tested within the pedigrees increases. The high number of discordants observed using the standardized diagnostic cut-off points is likely to reflect the presence of a second MHS susceptibility locus in the pedigree.

11394901|t|Identification of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the TATA box of the CYP2A6 gene: impairment of its promoter activity.
11394901|a|Human cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) constitutes the major nicotine oxidase, and large interindividual differences are seen in the levels of this enzyme, to a great extent caused by the distribution of several different polymorphic gene variants mainly located in the open reading frame (ORF). In the present study, we report a common polymorphism located in the 5' flanking region of CYP2A6 affecting its expression. DHPLC analysis and complete sequence of the open reading frame of the gene from a Turkish individual revealed a -48T > G substitution disrupting the TATA box. Using dynamic allele-specific hybridization (DASH), genotyping of this novel variant (named CYP2A6*9) was carried out in 116 Swedish, 132 Turkish, and 102 Chinese subjects, and the allele frequencies were found to be 5.2, 7.2, and 15.7%, respectively. The significance of the polymorphism was investigated by the construction of luciferase reporter plasmids containing 135 or 500 bp of the 5'-upstream region of the gene transfected into human hepatoma B16A2 cells. The constructs carrying the -48T > G mutation were only expressed at about 50% of the wild-type alleles. It is concluded that the CYP2A6*9 allele might be one of the most common CYP2A6 variants in Caucasians that alters the levels of enzyme expression.

11526490|t|STI571 inactivation of the gastrointestinal stromal tumor c-KIT oncoprotein: biological and clinical implications.
11526490|a|Mutations in the c-KIT receptor occur somatically in many sporadic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST), and similar mutations have been identified at the germline level in kindreds with multiple GISTs. These mutations activate the tyrosine kinase activity of c-KIT and induce constitutive signaling. To investigate the function of activated c-KIT in GIST, we established a human GIST cell line, GIST882, which expresses an activating KIT mutation (K642E) in the first part of the cytoplasmic split tyrosine kinase domain. Notably, the K642E substitution is encoded by a homozygous exon 13 missense mutation, and, therefore, GIST882 cells do not express native KIT. GIST882 c-KIT protein is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated, but tyrosine phosphorylation was rapidly and completely abolished after incubating the cells with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571. Furthermore, GIST882 cells evidenced decreased proliferation and the onset of apoptotic cell death after prolonged incubation with STI571. Similar results were obtained after administering STI571 to a primary GIST cell culture that expressed a c-KIT exon 11 juxtamembrane mutation (K558NP). These cell-culture-based studies support an important role for c-KIT signaling in GIST and suggest therapeutic potential for STI571 in patients afflicted by this chemoresistant tumor.

11849656|t|Influence of angiotensinogen M253T gene polymorphism and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor on restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention.
11849656|a|We studied the relation between renin-angiotensin system (RAS) related gene polymorphisms, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D), angiotensinogen (AGT) M253T and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) A1166C, and the effect of quinapril, an ACE inhibitor with high tissue-binding affinity, on preventing restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 253 patients successfully treated for coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to quinapril or control. Of the 215 patients who completed the follow-up, we determined gene polymorphisms in 204 patients with 241 lesions who provided blood samples for genotype determination. In the control, the ACE D homozygotes showed a smaller minimal lumen diameter (MLD) at follow-up (P=0.063). The other two genotypes of AGT and AT1R did not affect restenosis after PCI. According to quinapril treatment, the AGT T homozygotes significantly showed a beneficial effect of quinapril on MLD (P=0.013) and late lumen loss (P=0.013). The ACE I homozygotes also exhibited beneficial effects of quinapril on larger MLD (P=0.065). The AT1R genotype did not influence the quinapril effect. In conclusion, the AGT T homozygotes might benefit from effects of quinapril on preventing restenosis after PCI.

12059893|t|Mutation screening in the ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RYR1) in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia who show definite IVCT results: identification of three novel mutations.
12059893|a|BACKGROUND: The ryanodine receptor of the skeletal muscle (RYR1) seems to be of outstanding importance in the pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia (MH). It has been shown that point mutations in the RYR1 gene are strongly associated with the MH phenotype. A correctly determined phenotype is the basic prerequisite for adequate genetic MH screening. In this study we examined only those MH susceptible patients for the presence of potential RYR1 mutations who showed strong pathological muscle responses in the in vitro contracture test (IVCT). METHODS: A total of 56 MHS index patients who complied with the following IVCT criteria were included in the molecular genetic investigation: Contracture forces &gt; or =4 mN at a caffeine concentration of 2.0 mmol/l and &gt; or =8 mN at a halothane concentration of 0.44 mmol/l. DNA sequences of exons 2, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 39, 40, 45, 46, 102 of the RYR1 gene were analysed by the direct sequencing technique. Furthermore, if an MH mutation was identified in an index patient, all relatives were screened for their family specific RYR1 defect. RESULTS: In 39 index patients an RYR1 mutation was detected: Arg163Cys (n = 2), Asp166Asn (n = 1), Gly341Arg (n = 2), Arg401His (n = 2), Arg614Cys (n = 12), Asp2129Glu (n = 1),Vol2168Met (n = 1), Thr2206Met (n = 9), Ala2428Thr (n = 1), Gly2434Arg (n = 2), Arg2435His (n = 1), Arg2452Trp (n = 1), Arg2454His (n = 4). Three new RYR1 mutations were identified. We found a potential MH mutation in a further 130 relatives of the 39 index patients. Thirty-seven individuals were classified as MHS exclusively by molecular genetic techniques and did not have to undergo the IVCT. CONCLUSIONS: The ascertained high rate of successful MH mutation screening (69.64%) is obviously associated with the more clearly defined MHS diagnosis in the IVCT. According to the EMHG guidelines for the molecular genetic detection of MH susceptibility, a positive MH disposition could be determined in numerous persons by a less invasive technique.

12124989|t|RYR1 mutations causing central core disease are associated with more severe malignant hyperthermia in vitro contracture test phenotypes.
12124989|a|Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD) are autosomal dominant disorders of skeletal muscle. Susceptibility to MH is only apparent after exposure to volatile anesthetics and/or depolarizing muscle relaxants. CCD patients present with diffuse muscular weakness but are also at risk of MH. Mutations in RYR1 (19q13.1), encoding a skeletal muscle calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor), account for the majority of MH and CCD cases. Fifteen RYR1 N-terminal mutations are considered causative of MH susceptibility, five of which are also associated with CCD. In the first extensive UK population survey, eight of 15 mutations were detected in 85 out of 297 (29%) unrelated MH susceptible cases, with G2434R detected in 53 cases (18%). Mutation type was shown to affect significantly MH phenotypes (in vitro contracture test (IVCT) response to caffeine, halothane, and ryanodine). RYR1 mutations associated with both CCD and MH (R163C, R2163H, R2435H) had more severe caffeine and halothane response phenotypes than those associated with MH alone. Mutations near the amino terminal (R163C, G341R) had a relatively greater effect on responses to caffeine than halothane, with a significantly increased caffeine:halothane tension ratio compared to G2434R of the central domain. All phenotypes were more severe in males than females, and were also affected by muscle specimen size and viability. Discordance between RYR1 genotype and IVCT phenotype was observed in seven families (nine individuals), with five false-positives and four false-negatives. This represents the most extensive study of MH patient clinical and genetic data to date and demonstrates that RYR1 mutations involved in CCD are those associated with one end of the spectrum of MH IVCT phenotypes.

12185559|t|Morphine glucuronide-to-morphine plasma ratios are unaffected by the UGT2B7 H268Y and UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms in cancer patients on chronic morphine therapy.
12185559|a|OBJECTIVE: UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 is the major UGT isoform responsible for the 3- and 6-glucuronidation of morphine in humans. Studies in rats have indicated that UGT1A1 may also contribute to the formation of morphine 3-glucuronide (M3G). Our objective was to investigate whether the UGT2B7 H268Y and UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms contribute to the variability in morphine glucuronide-to-morphine plasma ratios among cancer patients undergoing analgesic therapy with morphine. METHODS: Seventy patients with normal hepatic and renal function using slow-release morphine to relieve cancer pain were included. UGT2B7 genotyping was performed using restriction enzyme analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA fragments. Wild-type and variant alleles of the UGT1A1 gene were identified using sizing of PCR-amplified fragments. Morphine 6-glucuronide (M6G)/morphine, M3G/morphine, and M3G/M6G plasma ratios were compared between genotypes. RESULTS: The M3G/morphine, M6G/morphine, and M3G/M6G plasma ratios varied 16-, 42-, and sevenfold, respectively, among individuals. No statistically significant differences in plasma ratios were found between individuals possessing UGT2B7 H/H ( n=20), H/Y ( n=30), or Y/Y ( n=20) genotypes. Five patients were homozygous for the UGT1A1 TA(7) allele, which is associated with reduced UGT1A1 gene expression. However, the mean M3G/M6G and M3G/morphine plasma ratios in TA(7) homozygous subjects did not differ significantly from those of heterozygous or homozygous wild-type (TA(6)) individuals. CONCLUSION: The UGT2B7 H268Y polymorphism cannot account for the considerable variation in glucuronide-to-morphine ratios in cancer patients. Moreover, the contribution of UGT1A1 to the formation of M3G appears to be of minor biological significance, at least in a UGT2B7 background.

12208804|t|Drug-induced long-QT syndrome associated with a subclinical SCN5A mutation.
12208804|a|BACKGROUND: Subclinical mutations in genes associated with the congenital long-QT syndromes (LQTS) have been suggested as a risk factor for drug-induced LQTS and accompanying life-threatening arrhythmias. Recent studies have identified genetic variants of the cardiac K+ channel genes predisposing affected individuals to acquired LQTS. We have identified a novel Na+ channel mutation in an individual who exhibited drug-induced LQTS. METHODS AND RESULTS: An elderly Japanese woman with documented QT prolongation and torsade de pointes during treatment with the prokinetic drug cisapride underwent mutational analysis of LQTS-related genes. A novel missense mutation (L1825P) was identified within the C-terminus region of the cardiac Na+ channel (SCN5A). The L1825P channel heterologously expressed in tsA-201 cells showed Na+ current with slow decay and a prominent tetrodotoxin-sensitive noninactivating component, similar to the gain-of-function phenotype most commonly observed for SCN5A-associated congenital LQTS (LQT3). In addition, L1825P exhibited loss of function Na+ channel features characteristic of Brugada syndrome. Peak Na+ current density observed in cells expressing L1825P was significantly diminished, and the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation was shifted toward more positive and negative potentials, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that subclinical mutations in the LQTS-related gene SCN5A may predispose certain individuals to drug-induced cardiac arrhythmias.

12563174|t|The Gln27Glu beta2-adrenoceptor polymorphism slows the onset of desensitization of cardiac functional responses in vivo.
12563174|a|Studies performed have shown that the Arg16Gly allele in beta-adrenoceptors (beta2AR) enhances susceptibility to agonist-induced down-regulation, while the Gln27Glu polymorphism diminishes it. In this study, we tested whether similar phenotypes occur in vivo. We assessed 32 volunteers (mean age 25 +/- 2 years) with different genotypes (group A: wild-type beta2AR, n = 16; group B: homozygous Glu27, n = 10; group C: homozygous Gly16, n = 6) for the effect of 2 weeks treatment with 3 x 5 mg/day oral terbutaline on terbutaline infusion-induced increases in heart rate and contractility (i.e. shortening of heart rate-corrected duration of electromechanical systole, QS2c). At baseline, terbutaline infusion increased heart rate and contractility similarly among subjects in the three groups. Treatment with oral terbutaline for 14 days reduced the ability of intravenous (i.v.) terbutaline to increase heart rate and contractility. The extent of this reduction was similar but the time course of desensitization differed among the three groups. While in groups A and C terbutaline infusion-induced increases in heart rate and contractility were reduced within 24 h after oral ingestion of terbutaline, a significant effect on response to terbutaline infusion was not evident for the first 3 days of terbutaline treatment in group B. The Arg16Gly and the Gln27Glu variants of the beta2AR do not alter the extent of agonist-induced beta2AR desensitization in vivo but Glu27 homozygotes develop desensitization more slowly. This result may have implications for cardiac side-effects in patients who are Glu27 homozygotes and who receive beta2AR agonist therapy.

12576843|t|Sildenafil response is influenced by the G protein beta 3 subunit GNB3 C825T polymorphism: a pilot study.
12576843|a|PURPOSE: Sildenafil is the oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that revolutionized treatment for erectile dysfunction. We investigated a potential association of the G protein beta 3 subunit (GNB3) C825T polymorphism, a determinant of intracellular signal transduction, with the drug response to sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 113 men with erectile dysfunction and 111 healthy male controls genotype status of the GNB3 C825T polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis. Patients with erectile dysfunction received sildenafil at a dose of 25 to 100 mg. according to the individual erectile response. Drug response was measured by interviewing the patient according to the erection scale of 0 to 5. RESULTS: The GNB3 genotype distribution of patients with erectile dysfunction exactly matched that of healthy controls. Analysis of the response to sildenafil revealed a significant association of C825T allele status with the erectile response to sildenafil. In the group with TT genotype we observed a 90.9% response but only a 50.9% and 48.9% response in patients with the CC and TC genotype, respectively. The odds ratio for a positive erectile response was 10.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 81.1) for patients with the TT versus the TC/CC genotype (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The response to sildenafil is significantly associated with GNB3 C825T genotype status in patients with erectile dysfunction.

12724618|t|Frequency of butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in individuals with abnormal inhibition numbers: an Italian-population study.
12724618|a|OBJECTIVES: More than 30 genetic variants of serum cholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase, BChE) have been described. Some of them (the atypical and the fluoride-resistant variants) are well known because carriers are prone to develop prolonged apnea following the administration of the muscle relaxant succinylcholine. Genotype characterization is therefore important in order to prevent such episodes. Genetic studies have so far focused on selected individuals or families rather than on the random population. METHODS: From a large group of healthy blood donors (n = 2609), we selected all the 58 individuals with low serum cholinesterase activity: among them 28 subjects had abnormal dibucaine and fluoride inhibition numbers. Twenty-five mutations in the coding region of the human cholinesterase gene were analyzed. RESULTS: All individuals with abnormal inhibition numbers were homozygotes or double heterozygotes in several mutations. Asp70Gly (Atypical variant) and Ala539Thr (K variant) were the most frequently observed amino acid substitutions. The majority of subjects with low BChE activity but normal dibucaine and fluoride number presented only the K form. We analyzed 106 randomly chosen subjects for K and atypical variants. Carriers of these alleles were at risk of low BChE activity (OR = 9.55, 95%CI, 5.61-16.26 and OR = 30.33, 95%CI, 7.05-130.52 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained from this study help to better define the etiology of low BChE activity and the role of the rather common K allele. It is the first time that such a large population has been screened for so many mutations. BChE is also implicated in detoxifying cocaine; therefore genetic analysis could be useful in cases of cocaine toxicity in Italian subjects.

12883402|t|Detection of a novel ryanodine receptor subtype 1 mutation (R328W) in a malignant hyperthermia family by sequencing of a leukocyte transcript.
12883402|a|BACKGROUND: To determine whether malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility in a Canadian pedigree is associated with a mutation in the ryanodine receptor subtype 1 (RYR1) gene, the complete RYR1 transcript obtained from the leukocytes of one MH-susceptible family member was sequenced, using a newly developed protocol. METHODS: RNA was extracted from leukocytes and converted into complementary DNA. Overlapping fragments of RYR1 complementary DNA were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and used for double-strand sequencing to find a single mutation likely to be causal of MH susceptibility. Inheritance of the mutation in the family was studied by restriction endonuclease analysis and/or sequencing of genomic DNA and compared to available caffeine halothane contracture test data. The mutation was introduced into rabbit RYR1 complementary DNA, the complementary DNA was expressed in human embryonic kidney line 293 cells, and Ca2+ release by the mutant Ca2+ release channel was measured following the addition of caffeine and halothane. RESULTS: A novel arginine 328 to tryptophan mutation in RYR1 was detected by direct sequencing of the RYR1 transcript from leukocytes of one MH-susceptible individual. A causal role for this mutation in MH is indicated by cosegregation of the mutation with the MH-susceptible phenotype within the family and by the demonstration that the mutant channel has increased sensitivity to both caffeine and halothane. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of using complete RYR1 transcripts from leukocytes for sequence analysis offers an efficient and noninvasive method for scanning RYR1 for novel mutations.

12914549|t|MDR1 polymorphisms G2677T in exon 21 and C3435T in exon 26 fail to affect rhodamine 123 efflux in peripheral blood lymphocytes.
12914549|a|P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a member of the ABC-transporter family, and in humans, is encoded by the MDR1 gene. Recently, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the MDR1 gene were identified. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the MDR1 genetic polymorphisms G2677T and C3435T on Pgp activity in CD56+ and CD4+ peripheral blood cells. Using flow cytometry, rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux was determined in 46 male healthy volunteers. Median Rh123 fluorescence in control sample, after baseline dye uptake, was set as 100%. Rh123 fluorescence in efflux samples, exposed to different efflux periods, was used to calculate the percentage of Rh123 retained in the cells in comparison with control. There was no significant difference in Rh123 efflux in CD56+ cells after 5, 10, 15, and 30 min efflux between individuals with different MDR1 genotypes. Also, in CD4+ cells after 15, 30, 60, and 90 min, Rh123 efflux did not reveal statistically different results for the three genotypes at 2677 and 3435. Rh123 efflux was not enhanced by a 10-day rifampin administration, as determined in 15 individuals before and after rifampin treatment. In conclusion, we found no impact of the MDR1 G2677T and C3435T polymorphisms on Pgp activity in CD56+ and CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes.

14586389|t|No effect of MDR1 C3435T variant on loperamide disposition and central nervous system effects.
14586389|a|BACKGROUND: The MDR1 gene encodes the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which is highly expressed in the small intestine and in the blood-brain barrier. A major function of P-glycoprotein is to limit the absorption and central nervous system exposure of numerous xenobiotics. A genetic polymorphism in the MDR1 gene (C3435T) has been associated with changes in the intestinal expression level and function of P-glycoprotein. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of this polymorphism on disposition and brain entry of the P-glycoprotein substrate loperamide. METHODS: Healthy white volunteers were genotyped for the MDR1 C3435T polymorphism, and a 16-mg oral dose of loperamide was administered to 8 subjects with the 3435TT genotype and 8 subjects with the 3435CC genotype. Plasma levels of loperamide were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Loperamide-induced respiratory depression was detected as the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and was used as a measure of central nervous system side effects. RESULTS: We found no significant difference in loperamide pharmacokinetics between individuals homozygous for the C and the T alleles in position 3435 of MDR1, as follows: peak plasma drug concentration, 3164 +/- 1053 pg/mL and 3021 +/- 984 pg/mL; area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 hours, 14414 +/- 4756 pg. h/mL and 14923 +/- 6466 pg. h/mL; and time to peak plasma drug concentration, 3.9 +/- 1.4 hours and 3.9 +/- 2.6 hours for the MDR1 3435CC and 3435TT genotypes, respectively (P &gt;.05, for all parameters). Hypercapnic ventilatory response changed only minimally after ingestion of loperamide (the coefficient of variation during the 0- to 8-hour period was 21% +/- 14% for the sample population), and there was no MDR1 3435 genotype-related effect on respiratory response. Carriers of the 2 major MDR1 haplotypes, MDR1*1 and MDR1*13, did not differ in their response to loperamide. CONCLUSION: There was no association between the MDR1 C3435T variation and plasma levels or central nervous system effects of the P-glycoprotein substrate loperamide in a white study population. The MDR1 haplotype structure was quite variable and supports the use of haplotypes instead of single nucleotide polymorphisms in determining clinical consequences of genetic variation.

14625131|t|Leptin receptor polymorphism is associated with serum lipid levels and impairment of cholesterol lowering effect by simvastatin in Japanese men.
14625131|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether leptin receptor (Ob-R) Arg223Gln polymorphism influences serum lipid levels and whether this polymorphism affects the efficiency of the cholesterol lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin [Clin. Cardiol. 16 (1993) 317]. DESIGN: Case-control association study. SUBJECTS: We studied 201 Japanese men without medical care, and 78 Japanese who took simvastatin. METHODS: Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Serum lipid and leptin levels were determined. RESULTS: Subjects with the Arg/Arg homozygotes had significantly higher serum total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels than those with the Arg/Gln heterozygotes and Gln/Gln homozygotes (TC: Arg/Arg: 213+/-3, Arg/Gln: 196+/-6, Gln/Gln: 184+/-5, P=0.004 for comparison among three genotypes, P=0.008 for difference between Arg/Arg and Arg/Gln, and P=0.025 for difference between Arg/Arg and Gln/Gln, LDL-C: Arg/Arg: 127+/-3, Arg/Gln: 112+/-6, Gln/Gln: 114+/-8, P=0.027) for comparison among three genotypes and P=0.011 for difference between Arg/Arg and Arg/Gln. Subjects with the Arg/Arg homozygotes had significantly lower serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than those with the Arg/Gln heterozygotes and Gln/Gln homozygotes (Arg/Arg: 55+/-1, Arg/Gln: 62+/-3, Gln/Gln: 57+/-7, P=0.046) for comparison among three genotypes and P=0.013 for difference between Arg/Arg and Arg/Gln. In addition, in 78 patients with hypercholesterolemia who took 5 mg simvastatin, the TC lowering effect by simvastatin in subjects with the Arg/Arg homozygotes was significantly lower than in those with the Arg/Gln heterozygotes and Gln/Gln homozygotes (the reduction in serum TC levels; 62+/-4 vs. 79+/-6, P=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that Ob-R Arg223Gln polymorphism in Japanese men is associated with significant elevation of serum TC and LDL-C levels. Our data also show that the Arg/Arg homozygotes tend to show lowered level of serum HDL-C. Furthermore, this polymorphism tends to show an attenuated response to an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in terms of the cholesterol lowering effect. These results suggest that the Ob-R gene may serve as a novel modifier gene for hypercholesterolemia in Japanese men.

14641996|t|Calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum is facilitated in human myotubes derived from carriers of the ryanodine receptor type 1 mutations Ile2182Phe and Gly2375Ala.
14641996|a|Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is caused by increased calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, triggered by volatile anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants. Numerous mutations associated with MH have been detected in the skeletal muscle type ryanodine receptor gene (RyR1), but so far facilitated calcium release has only been demonstrated for a few of them. This is a prerequisite for confirming the causative role of an RyR1 mutation for MH. Calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum induced by 4-chloro-m-cresol (4CmC), caffeine, and halothane was determined in human myotubes by calcium imaging. The RyR1 Ile2182Phe mutation and the RyR1 Gly2375Ala mutation have been identified in individuals susceptible to MH. In myotubes of individuals carrying the RyR1 Ile2182Phe or the RyR1 Gly2375Ala mutation, the EC(50) for caffeine and halothane was reduced; in the Ile2182Phe myotubes, the EC(50) for 4CmC was also reduced, all consistent with facilitated calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. From these data we conclude that both mutations are pathogenic for MH.

14975928|t|Molecular and functional characterization of common polymorphisms in HERG (KCNH2) potassium channels.
14975928|a|Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac repolarization disorder that can lead to arrhythmias and sudden death. Chromosome 7-linked inherited LQTS (LQT2) is caused by mutations in human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG; KCNH2), whereas drug-induced LQTS is caused primarily by HERG channel block. Many common polymorphisms are functionally silent and have been traditionally regarded as benign and without physiological consequence. However, the identification of common nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nSNPs; i.e., amino-acid coding variants) with functional phenotypes in the SCN5A Na(+) channel and MiRP1 K(+) channel beta-subunit have challenged this viewpoint. In this report, we test the hypothesis that common missense HERG polymorphisms alter channel physiology. Comprehensive mutational analysis of HERG was performed on genomic DNA derived from a population-based cohort of sudden infant death syndrome and two reference allele cohorts derived from 100 African American and 100 Caucasian individuals. Amino acid-encoding variants were considered common polymorphisms if they were present in at least two of the three study cohorts with an allelic frequency &gt;0.5%. Four nSNPs were identified: K897T, P967L, R1047L, and Q1068R. Wild-type (WT) and polymorphic channels were heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, and biochemical and voltage-clamp techniques were used to characterize their functional properties. All channel types were processed similarly, but several electrophysiological differences were identified: 1) K897T current density was lower than the other polymorphic channels; 2) K897T channels activated at more negative potentials than WT and R1047L; 3) K897T and Q1068R channels inactivated and recovered from inactivation faster than WT, P967L, and R1047L channels; and 4) K897T channels showed subtle differences compared with WT channels when stimulated with an action potential waveform. In contrast to K897T and Q1068R channels, P967L and R1047L channels were electrophysiologically indistinguishable from WT channels. All HERG channels had similar sensitivity to block by cisapride. Therefore, some HERG polymorphic channels are electrophysiologically different from WT channels.

15044558|t|UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B15 pharmacogenetics: UGT2B15 D85Y genotype and gender are major determinants of oxazepam glucuronidation by human liver.
15044558|a|Oxazepam is a commonly used 1,4-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug that is polymorphically metabolized in humans. However, the molecular basis for this phenomenon is currently unknown. We have previously shown that S-oxazepam glucuronide, the major oxazepam metabolite, is selectively formed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B15, whereas the minor R-oxazepam glucuronide is produced by multiple UGTs other than UGT2B15. Phenotype-genotype studies were conducted using microsomes and DNA prepared from the same set of 54 human livers. Sequencing of the UGT2B15 gene revealed three nonsynonymous polymorphisms, D85Y, T352I, and K523T, with variant allele frequencies of 0.56, 0.02, and 0.40, respectively. D85Y genotype showed a significant effect (p = 0.012) on S-oxazepam glucuronidation with lower median activities in 85Y/Y livers (49 pmol/min/mg protein) compared with 85D/D livers (131 pmol/min/mg), whereas 85D/Y livers were intermediate in activity (65 pmol/min/mg). There was also a significant trend (p = 0.049) for higher S-oxazepam activities in the two 352T/I livers (135 and 210 pmol/min/mg) compared with the remaining 352T/T livers (median, 64 pmol/min/mg). Conversely, K523T genotype had no apparent effect on oxazepam glucuronidation (p &gt; 0.05). Donor gender also significantly influenced S-oxazepam glucuronidation with higher median activities in male (65 pmol/min/mg) compared with female (39 pmol/min/ mg) livers (p = 0.042). R-Oxazepam glucuronidation was not affected by either genotype or gender (p &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, gender and D85Y genotype are identified as major determinants of S-oxazepam glucuronidation by human liver and may explain in part polymorphic oxazepam glucuronidation by human subjects.

15077008|t|Nicotine dependence in a prospective population-based study of adolescents: the protective role of a functional tyrosine hydroxylase polymorphism.
15077008|a|Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter of the mesolimbic reward pathway in the human brain, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis. Consequently, the gene encoding TH is a strong candidate for involvement in the genetic component of addiction. The importance of this gene in nicotine dependence is supported by many studies showing a link between nicotine administration and TH expression. A functional tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism within intron 1 of the TH gene (HUMTH01-VNTR) has been shown to modify tobacco use in two independent Caucasian samples from the USA and Australia. Using information drawn from an eight-wave Australian population-based longitudinal study of adolescent health, we tested the effect of the HUMTH01-VNTR on nicotine dependence. Comparisons were made between dependent smokers and non-dependent smokers. These data provide further support for a protective association between the K4 allele and dependent smoking (odds ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.28-1.0). No associations were observed at any of three other common TH polymorphisms (rs6356, rs6357 and HUMTH01-PstI). Including these data, three independent studies, two of which use identical phenotypes, have now identified a protective relationship between the K4 allele of the functional HUMTH01-VNTR polymorphism and high-level smoking.

15210166|t|Functional characterization of malignant hyperthermia-associated RyR1 mutations in exon 44, using the human myotube model.
15210166|a|Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder with an autosomal dominant inheritance. During exposure to triggering agents as volatile anaesthetics, affected individuals may develop a potentially fatal hypermetabolic syndrome caused by excessive calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle. More than 60 MH associated mutations were found in the gene of skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1), but only some of them have been functionally characterized. Primary human myotubes were cultured from carriers of RyR1 mutations in exon 44 (Ala2350Thr, Arg2355Trp, Gly2375Ala) and from MH non-susceptible individuals. Investigation of calcium homeostasis with the calcium sensitive probe Fura 2 showed a higher sensitivity to the ryanodine receptor agonists 4-chloro-m-cresol, caffeine and halothane for the myotubes derived from the mutation carriers as compared to those of the control group. The presence of RyR1 mutations with impact on calcium homeostasis emphasizes the functional significance of exon 44.

15522280|t|Role of a KCNH2 polymorphism (R1047 L) in dofetilide-induced Torsades de Pointes.
15522280|a|Various drugs are reported to prolong the QT-interval on the surface ECG, thereby increasing the risk of developing a potentially fatal arrhythmia known as Torsades de Pointes (TdP). TdP case reports for these drugs have often been associated with risk factors such as overdosing, concomitant drugs and/or existing pathophysiological conditions. A few cases appear to be devoid of these factors. To determine what role genetic variation in the hERG gene plays in drug-induced arrhythmias, we screened DNA samples collected from 105 atrial-fibrillation patients treated with dofetilide for polymorphisms, seven of whom developed TdP. An uncommon missense change, R1047L, was identified in two of seven patients who experienced TdP as compared with five of 98 individuals who were free of TdP. Included in the affected individuals was the only subject homozygous for this SNP. Cellular electrophysiological studies revealed a 10-mV positive shift in the steady-state activation curve of the 1047L hERG channel stably expressed in HEK-293 cells as compared with the wild-type (WT) channel. The activation and inactivation kinetics of the 1047L current were significantly slower than the WT (P &lt; 0.05) at given membrane potentials. A computer simulation using a rabbit ventricular myocyte model indicated that same extent of changes in the I(Kr) channel may result in an approximately 15% prolongation in the action potential duration. Our study suggests that 1047L leads to a functional impairment of the hERG channel, which may contribute to the higher incidence of TdP in 1047L carriers when challenged with a channel blocker.

15542732|t|Gene polymorphisms of the mu opioid receptor in methamphetamine abusers.
15542732|a|In drug addiction, the opioid system is thought to mediate motivational effects through dopamine-independent mechanisms. We have investigated associations of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM) variations with methamphetamine (MAP) dependence/psychosis. The allelic frequency of A118G (Asn40Asp) in exon 1 of ORPM was 45.3% in our control subjects, but only 7.5-25.8% in the Caucasian or African-American population of previous studies. We have identified several novel polymorphisms in intron 1 and the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of OPRM. Polymorphisms in the functionally relevant 5' regulatory region of OPRM were different in our Japanese population from Caucasian or African-American populations. No significant differences between controls and MAP abusers were found in either genotype or allele frequency at any single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or (AC)n dinucleotide repeat in intron 1. A subdivision of our MAP group revealed that A118G of OPRM shows a significant association with MAP psychosis having latency less than three years. Further analysis should be capable of identifying associations between the OPRM variations and MAP dependence/psychosis.

15608561|t|Response to micronized fenofibrate treatment is associated with the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors alpha G/C intron7 polymorphism in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
15608561|a|OBJECTIVE: The association between polymorphisms in candidate genes related to lipoprotein metabolism and the reduction in plasma triglyceride (TG) in response to fenofibrate treatment was evaluated in subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with micronized fenofibrate (200 mg/day) for at least 3 years in the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study. METHODS: The cholesteryl ester transfer protein Taq1B, LPL S447X, hepatic lipase -514 C--&gt;T, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors alpha (PPARA) L162V and G/C intron 7 polymorphisms and the apolipoprotein E2/E3/E4 alleles were genotyped using PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. Subjects were divided into high TG-responders (with &gt; 30% TG relative reduction after treatment) and low TG-responders. RESULTS: The frequency of the PPARA intron 7 G/G genotype was higher in high TG-responders than in low TG-responders (85% vs. 69%, P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between the percentage of high TG-responders and low TG-responders for any of the other genetic polymorphisms examined. In stepwise logistic regression, baseline TG and only the PPARA intron 7 polymorphism among the others were selected in the model as significant predictors of TG-response (odds ratio: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.28-7.52, P = 0.012 for PPARA polymorphism). With age, gender, body mass index, smoking status and HbA1c as additional factors, baseline TG (P&lt; 0.0001), intron 7 (P = 0.013), body mass index (P = 0.040) and LPL-S447X (P = 0.084) were significant predictors of TG-response. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that elevated baseline TG levels and PPARA gene intron 7 G/G genotype were associated with TG reduction &gt; 30% after fenofibrate treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Metabolism of nifedipine by the L293P (CYP3A4*18), M445T (CYP3A4*3), and P467S (CYP3A4*19) allelic variants was not significantly different from wild-type CYP3A4*1. However, F189S (CYP3A4*17) exhibited a &gt;99% decrease in both V(max) and CL(max) of nifedipine compared with CYP3A4*1. Of 72 racially diverse individuals, CYP3A4*17 was identified in 1 of 24 Caucasian samples [1:5 Eastern European (Adygei ethnic group)]. Genotyping of an extended set of 276 genomic DNAs of Caucasians (100 from the Coriell Repository and an additional 176 from the United States) for CYP3A4*17 detected no additional individuals containing the CYP3A4*17 allele. However, additional genotyping of four more Adygei samples available from Coriell detected an additional individual carrying the CYP3A4*17 allele. New specific polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism genotyping procedures were developed for the major splice variant of CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*3) and CYP3A4*17. Genotyping revealed that the two individuals carrying CYP3A4*17 were either homozygous or heterozygous for the more frequent CYP3A5*3 allele, suggesting that the two alleles may exist on the same chromosome as a new putative CYP3A poor metabolizer haplotype. We predict that individuals who are homozygous for defective alleles of both of these genes would metabolize CYP3A substrates poorly. The new genetic tests will be useful in future clinical studies to investigate genotype/phenotype associations.

15761113|t|UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A6 pharmacogenetics: II. Functional impact of the three most common nonsynonymous UGT1A6 polymorphisms (S7A, T181A, and R184S).
15761113|a|The objective of this study was to use recombinant enzymes and human liver microsomes (HLMs) to comprehensively evaluate the functional impact of the three most common nonsynonymous polymorphisms (S7A, T181A, and R184S) identified in the human UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A6 gene. In addition to the known allozymes, other possible amino acid variants were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells to enable structure-function analysis. Initial studies using different substrates (serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophol, 4-nitrophenol, acetaminophen, and valproic acid) showed similar results with 2-fold higher glucuronidation by UGT1A6(*)2 (S7A/T181A/R184S) compared with UGT1A6(*)1 (reference), and intermediate activities for other variants. Enzyme kinetic analyses with the UGT1A6-specific substrate (serotonin) showed 50% lower K(m) values for all R184S variants and 2-fold higher V(max) values for both S7A/T181A variants compared with UGT1A6(*)1. Furthermore, intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)) values were highest for the UGT1A6(*)2 allozyme (2.3-fold over UGT1A6(*)1), resulting from additive effects of higher enzyme affinity and activity. As expected, K(m) values of (*)1/(*)1 genotyped HLMs (5.4 +/- 0.2 mM) were similar to recombinant UGT1A6(*)1 (5.8 +/- 0.6 mM). Conversely, (*)2/(*)2 HLMs showed higher K(m) values (7.0 +/- 0.3 mM) rather than the lower K(m) values displayed by recombinant UGT1A6(*)2 (3.6 +/- 0.3 mM), suggesting that this allozyme may display different enzyme kinetic behavior in HLMs compared with HEK293 cells. At best, these polymorphisms were predicted to account for 15 to 20% of the observed 13-fold variability in glucuronidation of UGT1A6 substrates by HLMs, indicating that there are likely other genetic or environmental factors responsible for the majority of this variation.

15860653|t|Functional analysis of six human aryl hydrocarbon receptor variants in a Japanese population.
15860653|a|Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an important transcriptional regulator involved in the induction of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, UGT1A1, and UGT1A6. In this study, functional properties of four novel naturally occurring human AhR variants (K401R, N487D, I514T, and K17T/R554K) were examined along with the single variants K17T and R554K. The luciferase reporter assay using the CYP1A1 promoter reporter in HeLa cells treated with beta-naphthoflavone or 3-methylcholanthrene, which are known as typical agonists for AhR, showed that reporter activities of the K401R and N487D variants were reduced to 40 to 58% of those of wild-type (WT) but not of the other variants. Similarly, the K401R and N487D variants also reduced the omeprazole-induced reporter activities to approximately 56 and 74% of those of the WT, respectively. The reduced activities of the two variants were probably caused by the reduced protein expression levels, since the protein levels of the K401R and N487D variants were approximately 52 and 47% of the WT, respectively, without any changes in their mRNA levels. The reduced protein levels were recovered by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 [N-benzoyloxycarbonyl (Z)-Leu-Leu-leucinal], suggesting that the reduced protein levels were caused by the accelerated proteasomal degradation by a proteasome. Together, the current data demonstrate that the K401R and N487D variants reduce their apparent transcriptional activities, both ligand-induced and omeprazole-induced activation, probably through reduced protein expression. Thus, these two variants may influence drug metabolism through reduced induction of CYP1A1 and other target enzymes.

16081343|t|A common haplotype on methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene modifies the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on blood pressure in essential hypertension patients--a family-based association study.
16081343|a|Our recent study indicated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism may involve in genetic control of blood pressure response to treatment by benazepril, an ACE inhibitor. Currently, we proposed to further investigate whether short-term blood pressure response to benazepril, was modulated by haplotypes re-constructed from both C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in MTHFR gene. A total of 410 hypertensive patients recruited from 344 nuclear families were treated orally with benazepril at a daily dosage of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. Blood pressures were measured at baseline and on the 16th day of treatment. In addition, 689 family members of these patients were also genotyped. Among these patients, the frequency of MTHFR A1298C AA, AC and CC genotypes was 74.4%, 23.9%, and 1.7%, respectively. The frequency of MTHFR C677T CC, CT and TT genotypes was 23.7%, 51.2%, and 25.1%, respectively. Only three haplotypes, 677T-1298A (50.8%), 677C-1298A (35.7%), and 677C-1298C (13.5%) were re-constructed. Multivariate regression models with generalized estimating equation (GEE) correction detected that the individuals carrying one copy of haplotype 677C-1298C had significantly lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure response (DeltaDBP and DeltaSBP) to benazepril treatment (p= 0.003 and p =0.043, respectively), in comparison to those without haplotype 677C-1298C. The results of family-based association test further confirmed that haplotype 677C-1298C was more frequently transmitted in subjects with either lower residual of DeltaDBP or DeltaSBP. For residual of DeltaDBP, the p-values are 0.007 in an additive model and 0.005 in a dominant model. For residual of DeltaSBP, the p-values are 0.009 in an additive model and 0.006 in a dominant model. Our findings suggest that MTHFR 677C-1298C haplotype modulate blood pressure responsiveness to shortterm treatment of ACE inhibitor in Chinese essential hypertensive patients.

16302021|t|Response to fluoxetine and serotonin 1A receptor (C-1019G) polymorphism in Taiwan Chinese major depressive disorder.
16302021|a|Serotonin systems appear to play a key role in the pathogenesis of major depression and the therapeutic mechanisms of antidepressants. The firing rate of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons is controlled by somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (HTR1A) autoreceptors, and desensitization of these receptors is implicated in the antidepressant mechanism of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. We tested whether a functional polymorphism (C-1019G) in the promoter region of the HTR1A gene and serotonin-related genetic variants are related to fluoxetine antidepressant effect. We genotyped the HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism as well as polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (SERTPR), variable-number tandem-repeat polymorphisms in intron 2 (STin2) of the serotonin transporter gene, serotonin 2A receptor (T102C), tryptophan hydroxylase (A218C), and G-protein beta3 subunit (C825T) in 224 Chinese patients from southern Taiwan with major depression, who accepted 4-week fluoxetine treatment and therapeutic evaluation. Our results demonstrated that the HTR1A -1019C/C carriers (P=0.009) and SERTPR l/l carriers (P&lt;0.001) showed a better response to fluoxetine, while other polymorphisms were not associated with fluoxetine therapeutic response. The major limitation of this study is the lack of a placebo control. Future prospective study with placebo control may help to predict and individualize antidepressant treatment.

16330681|t|NAD(P)H oxidase and multidrug resistance protein genetic polymorphisms are associated with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
16330681|a|BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients treated with anthracyclines develop cardiotoxicity (anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity [ACT]), mainly presenting as arrhythmias (acute ACT) or congestive heart failure (chronic ACT). There are no data on pharmacogenomic predictors of ACT. METHODS AND RESULTS: We genotyped participants of the German non-Hodgkin lymphoma study (NHL-B) who were followed up for the development of heart failure for a median of &gt;3 years. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from 82 genes with conceivable relevance to ACT. Of 1697 patients, 55 developed acute and 54 developed chronic ACT (cumulative incidence of either form, 3.2%). We detected 5 significant associations with polymorphisms of the NAD(P)H oxidase and doxorubicin efflux transporters. Chronic ACT was associated with a variant of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunit NCF4 (rs1883112, -212A--&gt;G; symbols with right-pointing arrows, as edited?' odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3 to 5.0). Acute ACT was associated with the His72Tyr polymorphism in the p22phox subunit (rs4673; OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.9) and with the variant 7508T--&gt;A (rs13058338; OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 5.1) of the RAC2 subunit of the same enzyme. In agreement with these results, mice deficient in NAD(P)H oxidase activity, unlike wild-type mice, were resistant to chronic doxorubicin treatment. In addition, acute ACT was associated with the Gly671Val variant of the doxorubicin efflux transporter multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.6 to 8.4) and with the Val1188Glu-Cys1515Tyr (rs8187694-rs8187710) haplotype of the functionally similar MRP2 (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 5.4). Polymorphisms in adrenergic receptors previously demonstrated to be predictive of heart failure were not associated with ACT. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants in doxorubicin transport and free radical metabolism may modulate the individual risk to develop ACT.

16607077|a|To evaluate whether the interleukin-6 (IL-6) -174 G/C polymorphism might alter the effects of micronized fenofibrate or simvastatin therapy on inflammatory markers, we measured IL-6, C-reactive protein, CD40 ligand, adhesion molecules, P-selectin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in hypercholesterolemic patients both before and after a 30-day treatment. Serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with the GC or CC genotypes (P=0.04). The presence of the C allele was associated with greater absolute reduction of IL-6 levels (P=0.04) following fenofibrate treatment. There was no significant association between the -174 G/C IL-6 polymorphism and the effects of simvastatin treatment. A relationship between the -174 G/C IL-6 polymorphism and the anti-inflammatory action of fenofibrate reported might be useful in the optimization of the treatment regimen in patients receiving this class of drugs.

16842817|t|Disopyramide is an effective inhibitor of mutant HERG K+ channels involved in variant 1 short QT syndrome.
16842817|a|The recently identified idiopathic short QT syndrome (SQTS) is associated with an increased risk of arrhythmia and sudden death. The use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators helps to protect SQTS patients from ventricular fibrillation; however, pharmacological treatments to normalise the QT interval are limited: thus far only quinidine has been found to be effective in a subset of patients, with the SQT1 variant. SQT1 is associated with an amino acid substitution (N588K) in the KCNH2-encoded HERG K(+) channel that reduces HERG current (I(HERG)) inactivation and sensitivity to drug block. We demonstrate here that the N588K-HERG mutation only slightly attenuates I(HERG) blockade by the Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug disopyramide (1.5-fold elevation of IC(50)), compared to quinidine (3.5-fold elevation of IC(50)) and the Class III antiarrhythmic drug E-4031 (11.5-fold elevation of IC(50)). Thus, of the drugs studied to date, disopyramide is the one least affected by the SQT1 HERG mutation. Disopyramide is associated with QT prolongation in normal use and our findings provide a rational basis for its evaluation as a treatment for SQT1.

17085664|t|Novel D761Y and common secondary T790M mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant lung adenocarcinomas with acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors.
17085664|a|PURPOSE: In patients whose lung adenocarcinomas harbor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain mutations, acquired resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) has been associated with a second-site EGFR mutation, which leads to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 (T790M). We aimed to elucidate the frequency and nature of secondary EGFR mutations in patients with acquired resistance to TKI monotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor cells from patients with acquired resistance were examined for secondary EGFR kinase domain mutations by molecular analyses. RESULTS: Eight of 16 patients (50% observed rate; 95% confidence interval, 25-75%) had tumor cells with second-site EGFR mutations. Seven mutations were T790M and one was a novel D761Y mutation found in a brain metastasis. When combined with a drug-sensitive L858R mutation, the D761Y mutation modestly reduced the sensitivity of mutant EGFR to TKIs in both surrogate kinase and cell viability assays. In an autopsy case, the T790M mutation was found in multiple visceral metastases but not in a brain lesion. CONCLUSIONS: The T790M mutation is common in patients with acquired resistance. The limited spectrum of TKI-resistant mutations in EGFR, which binds to erlotinib in the active conformation, contrasts with a wider range of second-site mutations seen with acquired resistance to imatinib, which binds to ABL and KIT, respectively, in closed conformations. Collectively, our data suggest that the type and nature of kinase inhibitor resistance mutations may be influenced by both anatomic site and mode of binding to the kinase target.

17192902|t|The impact of epidermal growth factor receptor gene status on gefitinib-treated Japanese patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
17192902|a|We investigated the relationships between genetic factors and clinical outcome in Japanese non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with gefitinib. Ninety-eight NSCLC patients who had been treated with gefitinib, were screened for mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exons 18-21, KRAS exon2, and polymorphisms including the CA simple sequence repeat in intron1 (CA-SSR1) and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region (-216G/T and -191C/A), using a PCR-based assay and direct sequencing. The EGFR copy number status was also evaluated using a fluorescence in situ hybridization assay. EGFR and KRAS mutations were found in 38 (38.8%) and 8 (8.2%) of the 98 patients, respectively. A high EGFR copy number status was identified in 31 (41.3%) of the 75 assessable patients. Drug-sensitive EGFR mutations limited to exon19 deletions and L858R were independent predictive factors of a stronger sensitivity to gefitinib (p = 0.0002), the overall survival (OS) (p = 0.0036), and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) (p &lt; 0.0001). The EGFR copy number status was not related to a sensitivity to gefitinib and prolonged OS and PFS. Regarding polymorphisms, patients with a short CA-SSR1 showed a prolonged OS as compared with those with a long length in patients with a drug-sensitive EGFR mutation, although this difference was not significant (p = 0.13). Thus, drug-sensitive EGFR mutations predict a favorable clinical outcome and a high EGFR copy number may not be related to clinical benefits in gefitinib-treated Japanese patients with NSCLC. Our findings also suggest that the CA-SSR1 length may influence the clinical outcome in patients with a drug-sensitive EGFR mutation.

17286537|t|Exploratory analysis of four polymorphisms in human GGH and FPGS genes and their effect in methotrexate-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients.
17286537|a|The enzyme folylpoly-gamma-glutamase synthethase (FPGS) plays an important role in the intracellular polyglutamation of the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug methotrexate (MTX) and the length of the polyglutamated MTX product correlates with the time that MTX resides in the cell. The glutamates are released from MTX by activity of the enzyme gamma-glutamyl-hydrolase (GGH), thereby allowing the efflux of MTX. GGH 452C&gt;T has been associated with decreased catalytic activity and higher accumulation of long-chain MTX-polyglutamate. However, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FPGS and GGH genes have not yet been explored for association with MTX efficacy or toxicity. We selected for SNPs with frequencies higher than 10% or, in case of FPGS 114G&gt;A, causing an amino acid change with no known frequencies. In this study, frequencies of two SNPs in FPGS (1994A&gt;G and 114G&gt;A, rs10106 and rs10760502, respectively) and GGH genes (452C&gt;T and 16T&gt;C, rs11545078 and rs1800909, respectively), were determined using a newly developed method in rheumatoid arthritis patients (n = 352) and in a group of healthy controls (n = 360). Next, the SNPs were associated with response to MTX in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with MTX monotherapy. In rheumatoid arthritis patients, allele frequencies of FPGS 1994A&gt;G were 0.534 (A) and 0.466 (G), and for FPGS 114G&gt;A 0.714 (G) and 0.286 (A). Allele frequencies of GGH 16T&gt;C were 0.737 (T) and 0.263 (C) and for GGH 452C&gt;T 0.912 (C) and 0.088 (T). No significant differences in allele frequencies between rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls were found. In addition, the SNPs were not associated with good clinical response to MTX. Only patients with the GGH 16C-allele and one or no copies of the GGH 452C-16T haplotype were associated with good clinical improvement at 3 months upon treatment with MTX. No associations with efficacy at 6 months and MTX-induced toxicity were found. Therefore we conclude that despite the positive association of the GGH 16C-allele and one or no copies of the GGH 452C-16T haplotype with good clinical improvement at 3 months upon treatment with MTX, the tested SNPs in GGH and FPGS genes are suggested not to be clinically important for MTX treatment outcome.

17324111|t|Multidrug resistance 1 polymorphisms and trough concentrations of atazanavir and lopinavir in patients with HIV.
17324111|a|INTRODUCTION: HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors may benefit from therapeutic drug monitoring-assisted dose adjustment to achieve target plasma concentrations. However, efflux pumps such as permeability-glycoprotein, which is encoded by the multidrug resistance (MDR)1 gene, may decrease intracellular drug concentrations, thus reducing the amount of drug at the site of action. Plasma concentrations of protease inhibitors and CD4 cell count response have been associated with the T allele at the MDR1 C3435T locus. We examined MDR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms in a cohort of patients in whom therapeutic drug monitoring is ongoing through a research protocol. METHODS: In a multicenter study, genotypic analyses at two MDR1 loci, C3435T and G2677T, were performed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction method using DNA from 103 patients categorized as substance users or nonusers on atazanavir or lopinavir as the primary antiretrovirals. Allelic frequencies were determined as a function of racial/ethnic background, substance use status and trough concentrations of atazanavir and lopinavir. RESULTS: The C/T and G/T alleles at the MDR1 C3435T and G2677T loci were equally frequent in the Caucasian population, but the wild-type alleles were more prevalent in the African-American population (59% homozygous [CC] and 32% heterozygous [CT] for C3435T; 80% homozygous [GG] and 16% heterozygous [GT] for G2677T). The frequencies in the Hispanic population were 46% CC and 38% CT for C3435T, and 58% GG and 38% GT for G2677T. No significant differences were seen in allele frequencies for MDR1 polymorphisms in substance user versus nonuser groups. Trough plasma concentrations of atazanavir or lopinavir were not correlated with the variant T allele. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the higher prevalence of wild-type alleles of the MDR1 gene in African-Americans and the linkage disequilibrium between C3435T and G2677T loci. The T allele at the MDR1 C3435T and G2677T loci was not associated with higher atazanavir or lopinavir trough concentrations.

17394430|a|To investigate the influence of the S447X variant in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene on the response rate to therapy with the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone. A total of 113 diabetic patients were treated with pioglitazone 30 mg for 10 weeks. Response to the pioglitazone treatment was defined by either a &gt;10% relative reduction in fasting blood glucose (FBG) or a more than 1% decrease in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values after 10 weeks of pioglitazone treatment. The genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Using the criteria &gt;10% relative reduction in FBG after 10 weeks of pioglitaone treatment, responder frequency to pioglitazone treatment in S447S genotype group is significantly higher than S447X genotype group. Meanwhile, the S447X genotype conferred a statistically significant 0.538-fold reduction in response rate to pioglitazone treatment relative to the S447S genotype. Moreover, pioglitazone treatment has significantly beneficial effects on serum lipid profile and blood pressure in S447S genotype carriers. The S447X variant in LPL gene may be a cause for therapy modification by pioglitazone.

17457342|t|Megalin genetic polymorphisms and individual sensitivity to the ototoxic effect of cisplatin.
17457342|a|Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are dose-limiting side effects of cisplatin. Megalin, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, is highly expressed in renal proximal tubular cells and marginal cells of the stria vascularis of the inner ear - tissues, which accumulate high levels of platinum-DNA adducts. On the assumption that the mechanisms of cisplatin-induced nephro- and ototoxicity involve megalin we analyzed the incidence of the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs2075252 and rs4668123 in 25 patients who developed a distinct hearing loss during cisplatin therapy and in 25 patients without hearing impairment after cisplatin therapy. We found no association between cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and any allele of rs4668123 but observed a higher frequency of the A-allele of rs2075252 in the group with hearing impairment than in the group with normal hearing after cisplatin therapy (0.32 versus 0.14) (chi(2)=5.83, P&lt;0.02; odds ratio: 3.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.11-11.2) indicating that SNPs at the megalin gene might impact the individual susceptibility against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.

17460608|t|Genetic variation in the renal sodium transporters NKCC2, NCC, and ENaC in relation to the effects of loop diuretic drugs.
17460608|a|There is little data on genetic predictors of loop diuretic efficacy in humans. Therefore, we investigated the diuretic effects of single oral doses of bumetanide, frusemide, and torsemide in a crossover study in 97 healthy Caucasians in relation to genetic variation in the renal sodium transporters NKCC2 (coded by SLC12A1), NCC (SLC12A3), and ENaC (three subunits coded by SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). The NCC alanine 264 allele (Gly264Ala) and the most frequent SCNN1B haplotype were associated with stronger diuresis, indicating lower reabsorbing function of these alleles. The variant alleles of the tightly coupled polymorphisms rs5723 (Leu649Leu) and rs5729 in SCNN1G were associated with weaker diuresis, indicating higher activity. Extended haplotype homozygosity implied evolutionary selection of the NCC alanine 264 allele. In conclusion, acute diuretic effects of loop diuretics were affected by genetic variation in sodium transporters that, in the nephron, are located distally from NKCC2.

17467808|t|Genetic variability at HPA axis in major depression and clinical response to antidepressant treatment.
17467808|a|BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been observed in major depression. Normalization of HPA axis has been suggested to play a role in the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. Our aim was to investigate the influence of genetic variants in CRHR1, CRHR2, CRH-BP and FKBP5 genes on both the vulnerability for depression and the response to antidepressant treatment. METHODS: The sample consisted of 159 depressive outpatients and 96 healthy controls of Spanish origin. Patients were assessed for clinical features including, among others, age of onset, seasonality or suicidal behavior. The episode was treated with citalopram and followed along 12 weeks. Severity of symptoms was evaluated at the inclusion and then monthly along the follow-up using a 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Score (HDRS). SNPs were assayed using Applied Biosystems SNaP-Shot and TaqMan technology. RESULTS: rs110402, in CRHR1 gene, was associated with an increased risk to present a seasonal pattern and an early age of onset of the first depressive episode. Allele G carriers of rs2270007 of CRHR2 gene, showed a worse overall response to citalopram along time of follow-up (Genotype effect F=7.45, P=0.007). G allele carriers showed 2.93 increased risk (95% CI [1.24-6.90]) for non-responding at 4th week to citalopram treatment (chi(2)=7.59, df=1, P=0.006). LIMITATIONS: On the light of the moderate sample size, associations based on the mentioned polymorphisms need to be considered with caution and require further replication studies in other samples. CONCLUSIONS: Variability at genes encoding proteins with a pivotal role in HPA axis regulation seems to influence i) the expression of severity variables of the depressive spectrum including early age of onset or a seasonal pattern and ii) the interindividual variation in clinical response to SSRI antidepressants.

17710899|t|Molecular genetic detection of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia in Belgian families.
17710899|a|Malignant hyperthermia is an autosomal dominant myopathy triggered by volatile anesthetics or succinylcholine in susceptible persons. While in vitro contracture testing (IVCT) is the gold standard to establish malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility, genetic analysis is increasingly used to diagnose this condition. This work aimed to determine the frequency and distribution of ryanodine receptor (RYR1) mutations in the Belgian MH-population as investigated by IVCT in our centre, as well as the discordance rates between the 2 techniques. Sequence analysis of 16 RYRI-exons in 29 selected families resulted in the detection of 10 mutations (4 Gly341Arg, 2 Arg614Leu, and 1 Cys35Arg, Arg614Cys, Arg2163Cys and Arg2435His). Discordance between IVCT and mutation analysis was observed in only 6 out of 96 individuals from 4 different families. No mutation-positive/ IVCT-negative diagnosis was found. Genetic evaluation of RYR1-mutations can secure a diagnosis and aid in genetic counselling of individual family members but only in those families in which significant clinical information is present, as well as phenotyping by IVCT has been realized.

17914325|t|Pharmacogenetics in modern psychiatry.
17914325|a|There is no unique scientific agreement about genetic variations that could beyond any doubt predict phenotype of the response to pharmacotherapy. The knowledge about the predictors for therapy and serious adverse effects could be very useful in clinical practice. It is obvious that the combination of variation in metabolizing enzymes, transporter proteins and drug targets fully explains heterogeneity in response to psychiatric treatment. We assume that genetic polymorphisms of serotoninergic transporter and MDR1 could be important in prediction of therapeutic response in patients with major depression treated with paroxetine. Our results show that SERTPR-LL genotype might predispose significantly better paroxetine treatment response compared to SS genotype in MDD patients and that variants G2677T and C3435T are not associated with therapeutic response to paroxetine in patients with major depressive disorder.

18004207|t|Population-specific effects of the Asn40Asp polymorphism at the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) on HPA-axis activation.
18004207|a|BACKGROUND: Studies in European Americans (EAs) have shown that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis activation by the opioid blockade is moderated by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A118G (Asn40Asp) at the mu-opioid receptor locus (OPRM1). We examined the effect of this, and of five intronic OPRM1 SNPs, on adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol concentrations, following the placebo-controlled administration of naloxone to healthy individuals who were of EA or Asian ancestry. METHODS: We used a balanced, within-participant design with two test sessions to examine the hormonal responses to intravenous naloxone (an opioid antagonist) (125 microg/kg) or placebo in 29 healthy participants (62% men, 59% of Asian ancestry). DNA isolated from whole blood was PCR amplified and genotyped using a fluorogenic 5 nuclease assay (TaqMan) method. RESULTS: Consistent with earlier reports, participants with one or two Asp40 alleles (n=16) had a significantly greater cortisol response to naloxone than Asn40 homozygotes, but the effect was limited to EAs. Asians with the Asp40 allele did not show a greater increase in cortisol response compared with Asn40 homozygotes. None of the intronic SNPs was associated with cortisol response either directly or via an interaction effect with Asn40Asp. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of the Asn40Asp polymorphism at OPRM1 on HPA-axis activation seem to be population-specific. The association between the Asn40Asp and the HPA-axis response to naloxone cannot, therefore, be explained with reference only to the amino acid substitution encoded by that polymorphism. Further research to understand the basis for the observed association is warranted.

18025780|t|HFE genotype influences erythropoiesis support requirement in hemodialysis patients: a prospective study.
18025780|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: HFE protein controls iron absorption and cycling, and HFE mutations influence iron status. The aim was to evaluate the effect of the HFE genotype on the need for iron and erythropoietin in Italian hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Ninety-six prevalent patients were evaluated at the time of enrolment and prospectively followed for 3 years. Patients were given r-HuEPO and Fe3+-gluconate according to guidelines. The HFE genotype was determined by restriction analysis. RESULTS: Three patients (3%) carried the C282Y mutation, 4 (4%) were homozygous and 18 (19%) heterozygous for the H63D mutation, and 71 (74%) were negative for both. At enrolment, subjects positive for HFE mutations had higher iron stores (ferritin 617 +/- 663 vs. 423 +/- 386 ng/ml, p = 0.05), were receiving less iron (82.5 +/- 66 vs. 110 +/- 154 mg/month, p = 0.05) and a lower r-HuEPO dosage (98 +/- 83 vs. 142 +/- 138 U/kg/week, p = 0.03). Consistently during the study period, patients positive for HFE mutations received a lower amount of r-HuEPO (94.5 +/- 63 vs. 186 +/- 344 U/kg/week, p = 0.01) and iron (97 +/- 63 vs. 121 +/- 68 mg/month, p = 0.07). Upon Cox regression analysis, after adjustment for confounding variables, the presence of HFE mutations was associated with a reduced risk of death (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.34-1.03, p = 0.06). CONCLUSION: HFE mutations reduce the amount of r-HuEPO and iron necessary to support erythropoiesis in hemodialysis.

18055561|t|The neuronal nicotinic receptor subunit genes (CHRNA6 and CHRNB3) are associated with subjective responses to tobacco.
18055561|a|Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been implicated in various measures of nicotine dependence. In this paper, we present findings from an exploratory study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genes with tobacco and alcohol phenotypes, including frequency of use and three subjective response factors occurring shortly after initiation of use. Subjects were 1056 ethnically diverse adolescents ascertained from clinical and community settings. The most significant associations were found between two CHRNB3 SNPs (rs4950 and rs13280604) and the three subjective response factors to initial tobacco use. These findings were replicated in a separate community sample of 1524 families participating in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Both CHRNB3 SNPs were found to be associated with similar measures of subjective response to tobacco. These results indicate that early subjective response to nicotine may be a valuable endophenotype for genetic studies aimed at uncovering genes contributing to nicotine use and addiction.

18245543|t|A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the aromatase gene is associated with the efficacy of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole in advanced breast carcinoma.
18245543|a|PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole in breast cancer patients segregated with respect to DNA polymorphisms of the aromatase gene CYP19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal patients (n = 67) with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer were treated with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. PCR allelic discrimination was used to examine three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in DNA obtained from breast carcinoma tissue. Two SNPs analyzed (rs10046 and rs4646) were located in the 3' untranslated region and one (rs727479) was in the intron of the aromatase CYP19 gene. The primary end point of treatment efficacy was time to progression (TTP). RESULTS: Median age was 62 years and median number of metastatic sites was 2. Observed allelic SNP frequencies were rs10046, 71%; rs4646, 46%; and rs727479, 63%. Of the 67 patients, 65 were evaluable for efficacy. Median TTP was 12.1 months. We observed no relationship between TTP and the rs10046 or rs727479 variants. In contrast, we found that TTP was significantly improved in patients with the rs4646 variant, compared with the wild-type gene (17.2 versus 6.4 months; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: In patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole, the presence of a SNP in the 3' untranslated region of the CYP19 aromatase gene is associated with improved treatment efficacy. Testing for the CYP19 rs4646 SNP as a predictive tool for breast cancer patients on antiaromatase therapy deserves prospective evaluation.

18349289|t|Gilbert's Syndrome and irinotecan toxicity: combination with UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A7 variants increases risk.
18349289|a|BACKGROUND: Gilbert's syndrome is characterized by a functional promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 gene and represents a pharmacogenetic risk factor for irinotecan toxicity, but study data remain controversial. The active CPT-11 metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin is detoxified by several UGT1A proteins, which include UGT1A7 with a high specific activity that may contribute to the risk of irinotecan toxicity in Gilbert's syndrome patients. METHODS: Genotyping of the UGT1A1*28, UGT1A7 N129K/R131K, and UGT1A7-57T/G variants was done in 105 irinotecan-treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer; adverse events were documented during all 297 treatment cycles and analyzed by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, Mann-Whitney, and chi2 tests. RESULTS: The presence of UGT1A7 but not UGT1A1 variants was associated with at least one adverse event. In patients combining all three variants, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were significantly more frequent. The overall incidence of adverse events was significantly higher (P = 0.0035) in carriers of the UGT1A risk alleles, who also had significantly higher rate of dose reductions. CONCLUSIONS: Irinotecan toxicity is more likely in patients with Gilbert's syndrome carrying the UGT1A1*28 allele combined with reduced function UGT1A7 N129K/R131K and UGT1A7-57T/G SNP. Based on the ability of UGT1A7 to metabolize and eliminate the active irinotecan metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, the UGT1A1/UGT1A7 SNP combination haplotype appears to be a superior risk predictor than Gilbert's syndrome alone.

18398146|t|Variation in bleomycin hydrolase gene is associated with reduced survival after chemotherapy for testicular germ cell cancer.
18398146|a|PURPOSE: Response to chemotherapy may be determined by gene polymorphisms involved in metabolism of cytotoxic drugs. A plausible candidate is the gene for bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH), an enzyme that inactivates bleomycin, an essential component of chemotherapy regimens for disseminated testicular germ-cell cancer (TC). We investigated whether the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A1450G of the BLMH gene (rs1050565) is associated with survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected on survival and BLMH genotype of 304 patients with TC treated with bleomycin-containing chemotherapy at the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands, between 1977 and 2003. Survival according to genotype was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank testing and Cox regression analysis with adjustment for confounders. RESULTS: BLMH gene SNP A1450G has a significant effect on TC-related survival (log-rank P = .001). The homozygous variant (G/G) genotype (n = 31) is associated with decreased TC related survival compared with the heterozygous variant (A/G; n = 133) and the wild-type (A/A; n = 140). With Cox regression the G/G genotype proves to be an unfavorable prognostic factor, in addition to the commonly used International Germ Cell Consensus Classification prognosis group, with a hazard ratio of 4.97 (95% CI, 2.17 to 11.39) for TC-related death. Furthermore, the G/G genotype shows a higher prevalence of early relapses. CONCLUSION: The homozygous variant G/G of BLMH gene SNP A1450G is associated with reduced survival and higher prevalence of early relapses in TC patients treated with bleomycin-containing chemotherapy. This association is hypothesis generating and may eventually be of value for risk classification and selection for alternative treatment strategies in patients with disseminated TC.

18430057|t|Effect of statin therapy on plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels is modified by paraoxonase 1 in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease.
18430057|a|1. We sought to determine the effects of Q192R polymorphism of paraoxonase 1 (PON1) gene on plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and the response to statin therapy in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). 2. Two hundred and thirty-six patients with CHD were treated with simvastatin 20 mg/day. Fasting serum lipids were determined before and after 12 weeks of treatment. 3. No significant differences were detected among the PON1 Q192R polymorphism with respect to plasma lipids. In addition, the effects of simvastatin to increase HDL-C levels were significantly greater in patients with the RR genotype compared with patients with the QR or RR genotypes (P &lt; 0.05). 4. We conclude that the Q192R polymorphism of PON1 significantly modulates the HDL-C response to simvastatin in Chinese patients with CHD.

18444945|t|Association of four DNA polymorphisms with acute rejection after kidney transplantation.
18444945|a|Renal transplant outcomes exhibit large inter-individual variability, possibly on account of genetic variation in immune-response mediators and genes influencing the pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. We examined 21 polymorphisms from 10 genes in 237 de novo renal transplant recipients participating in an open-label, multicenter study [Cyclosporine Avoidance Eliminates Serious Adverse Renal-toxicity (CAESAR)] investigating renal function and biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) with different cyclosporine A regimens and mycophenolate mofetil. Genes were selected for their immune response and pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic relevance and were tested for association with BPAR. Four polymorphisms were significantly associated with BPAR. The ABCB1 2677T allele tripled the odds of developing BPAR (OR: 3.16, 95% CI [1.50-6.67]; P=0.003), as did the presence of at least one IMPDH2 3757C allele (OR: 3.39, 95% CI [1.42-8.09]; P=0.006). BPAR was almost fivefold more likely in patients homozygous for IL-10 -592A (OR: 4.71, 95% CI [1.52-14.55]; P=0.007) and twice as likely in patients with at least one A allele of TNF-alpha G-308A (OR: 2.18, 95% CI [1.08-4.41]; P=0.029). There were no statistically significant interactions between polymorphisms, or the different treatment regimens. Variation in genes of immune response and pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic relevance may be important in understanding acute rejection after renal transplant.

18591455|t|Physiological interaction between alpha-adducin and WNK1-NEDD4L pathways on sodium-related blood pressure regulation.
18591455|a|The kidney plays an important role in salt and blood pressure (BP) homeostasis. In previous studies, variants in the genes for alpha-adducin (ADD1), WNK1, and NEDD4L, which all regulate renal sodium absorption, have been associated with increased BP. However, findings have been inconsistent. We tested whether this is because of physiological interactions between the effects of variants in these genes. We assessed the single and combined effects of the ADD1 (Gly460Trp), WNK1 (rs880054 A/G), and NEDD4L (rs4149601 G/A) polymorphisms on renal and BP response to an acute Na load (n=344 subjects), BP decrease after 1 month of treatment with 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (n=193), and ambulatory 24-hour BP (n=690). Individually, the variants showed modest effects on some of the studied phenotypes. We found the ADD1 Trp allele to be permissive for the effects of variants of the other genes. In combination, the same variants (ADD1 Trp/WNK1 GG/Nedd4L GA+AA) showed a consistent effect on renal Na handling (P=0.009) and acute BP response to a saline infusion (P=0.021), BP lowering after thiazide treatment (P=0.008), and nocturnal systolic BP (P=0.044). Physiological interaction between the ADD1 and WNK1-NEDD4L pathways influences the effects of variants in these genes on sodium-related BP regulation. Relatively common alleles in the ADD1, WNK1, and NEDD4L genes when present in combination may have significant effects on renal sodium handling, BP, and antihypertensive response to thiazides.

18780301|t|Variability of AChE, BChE, and ChAT genes in the late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease and relationships with response to treatment with Donepezil and Rivastigmine.
18780301|a|Several factors are believed to give rise to the late onset sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We have studied the variation at the genes of three enzymes of the cholinergic system: acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and choline acetyltransferase. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) examined were: AChE rs2571598, BChE rs1355534, BChE rs1803274, and ChAT rs2177369. The sample for the case-control study was 471 LOAD patients aged 60 years or older, and 254 subjects with no neurodegenerative disorders as the control group. A significant difference in the genotype distribution between patients and controls was observed only for ChAT rs2177369, showing that the G/G genotype was to be considered a risk factor with respect to the G/A + A/A genotypes (odds ratio = 1.56; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.10-2.22; P = 0.01). Though indicating a significant association with AD onset, our results are far from definitive since contrast with the ones reported by other authors in a previous case-control study, and call for further investigations. Among patients, 171 took part in an observational study concerning the possible role of the genetic composition on the efficacy of treatment with Donepezil and Rivastigmine. We related the SNPs of the above cited genes with cognitive status measured by MMSE. Carrying an allele or a genotype of these SNPs does not seem to play a relevant role in the response to treatment with the two cholinesterase inhibitors, though some significant results were found associated with the AChE A/A genotype that had the best response when treated with Rivastigmine.

18794724|t|Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene is associated with major depression and antidepressant treatment response.
18794724|a|OBJECTIVE: Evidence suggests that plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 gene (SERPINE1) is a stress-related gene and serum plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 levels are increased in patients with major depressive disorders (MDD). METHODS: To investigate whether common genetic variation in the SERPINE1 gene is associated with MDD and the therapeutic response to antidepressants, six polymorphisms (rs2227631, rs1799889, rs6092, rs6090, rs2227684 and rs7242) of the SERPINE1 gene were genotyped in 188 Chinese MDD patients and 346 controls. Among the MDD patients, 140 accepted selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine or citalopram) antidepressant treatment for 4 weeks with therapeutic evaluation before and after. RESULTS: In single-marker-based analysis, the rs2227684-G and rs7242-T alleles were more frequent in MDD patients than in controls (P=0.010 and 0.010, respectively). The haplotype derived from the rs6090-G, rs2227684-G and rs7242-T polymorphisms was 1.19-fold higher in patients with MDD than in controls (P=0.0038). Haplotype analysis in responders (defined as a 50% reduction of the initial Hamilton score) and nonresponders after 4 weeks of antidepressant treatment showed that the haplotype derived from the rs2227631-G and rs1799889-4G polymorphisms was lower in responders than nonresponders (11.4 vs. 22.4%, P=0.014). CONCLUSION: Our findings show, for the first time, that SERPINE1 genetic variants may play a role in MDD susceptibility and in the acute therapeutic response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

18816295|t|Effect of D256N and Y483D on propofol glucuronidation by human uridine 5'-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A9).
18816295|a|Uridine 5'-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are part of a major elimination pathway for endobiotics and xenobiotics. UGT1A9 is a UGT that catalyses the conjugation of endogenous oestrogenic and thyroid hormones, acetaminophen, SN-38 (an active metabolite of irinotecan) and phenols. UGT1A9 is the only isoform that catalyses the glucuronidation of propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) in the liver. In the present study, we analysed polymorphisms of UGT1A9 in 100 healthy adult Japanese volunteers. A transversion of 766G > A resulting in the amino acid substitution of D256N was detected in exon 1. The allele frequency of D256N is 0.005. We investigated the effects of D256N and Y483D, which is located on the common exon of UGT1, on propofol glucuronidation by an in vitro expression study. The K(m) of wild-type, D256N and Y483D for propofol glucuronidation were 111.2, 43.6 and 64.5 microM, respectively. The V(max) of D256N and Y483D were 8.1% and 28.8%, and the efficiencies (V(max)/K(m)) were 19.1% and 57.1% of the wild-type, respectively. For mycophenolic acid, 1-naphthol and naringenin, the D256N variant lowered glucuronidation activity considerably, compared to Y483D. The V(max) value of D256N variant for mycophenolic acid was only 9.5% of the wild-type. This study shows the importance of D256N in differences between individuals concerning adverse effects of drugs that are catalysed primarily by UGT1A9. Carriers of D256N may be at risk of suffering adverse effects of propofol and other substrates that are primarily metabolized by UGT1A9.

18926547|t|Effects of DRD2/ANKK1 gene variations and clinical factors on aripiprazole efficacy in schizophrenic patients.
18926547|a|OBJECTIVES: Aripiprazole, a novel antipsychotic agent, acts as a partial agonist at dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2). We investigate whether its efficacy is predictable by DRD2/ANKK1 gene polymorphisms and clinical factors in Han Chinese hospitalized patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia. METHOD: After hospitalization, the patients (n=128) were given aripiprazole for up to 4 weeks. They were genotyped for four functional DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphisms: -141 Ins/Del, Ser311Cys, C957T, and TaqIA. Clinical factors such as gender, age, illness duration, education level, diagnostic subtype, and medication dosage were also recorded. Psychopathology was measured biweekly with the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). The effects of genetic and clinical factors on PANSS performance upon aripiprazole treatment were analyzed by a mixed modeling approach (SAS Proc MIXED). RESULTS: Compared to the patients with TaqI A2/A2 genotype, A1 carriers are associated with superior therapeutic response on positive symptoms after 4-week aripiprazole treatment. Regarding the C957T polymorphism, patients with C/C genotype were associated with poor aripiprazole response for excitement symptoms when compared with T/T patients. The other two polymorphisms, -141 Ins/Del, and Ser311Cys, have no significant effects on PANSS performance. The clinical factors including medication dosage, illness duration, and diagnostic subtype could influence PANSS performance upon aripiprazole treatment. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that DRD2/ANKK1 gene variations and some clinical factors may predict individual response to aripiprazole.

18992959|t|Prospective phase II study of gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations.
18992959|a|BACKGROUND: This study prospectively assessed the efficacy of gefitinib and the survival benefit for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. METHOD: Patients with either recurrent disease after undergoing surgery or advanced NSCLC disease (IIIB or IV) which demonstrated EGFR mutations were eligible for this study. EGFR mutations in exons 19-21 were examined. The patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled in this study after obtaining their informed consent a second time, and they were thereafter treated with gefitinib. RESULTS: EGFR mutations were detected in 20 of 48 patients with NSCLC, and 19 patients were enrolled onto this study and treated with gefitinib. Seven patients had an exon 19 deletion, 10 had L858R, 1 had both, and 1 had an exon 19 deletion and G796A. The overall response rate was 63.2%, and the disease control rate was 89.5%. In patients with an exon 19 del and L858R, the response rates were 71.4% and 60.0%, respectively. The median progression-free survival time was 7.1 months, and the median survival time was 20.0 months. No life-threatening toxicity was observed. Four of five acquired resistant tumors showed an acquired T790M mutation. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR mutations in exons 19 or 21 are considered to be a good predictor of the efficacy of gefitinib.

19027114|t|Tissue factor +5466A&gt;G polymorphism determines thrombin formation following vascular injury and thrombin-lowering effects of simvastatin in patients with ischemic heart disease.
19027114|a|OBJECTIVE: We examined the hypothesis that the +5466A&gt;G variant (rs3917643) of the tissue factor (TF) gene is associated with thrombin formation following simvastatin in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Prothrombin 1.2 fragments (F1.2) and thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) were assessed in 95 men with stable IHD, aged 54.4+/-6.8 years, in blood collected every 60s from the bleeding-time wounds before and after a 3-month simvastatin administration (40 mg/day). We identified 16 patients with the TF +5466AG genotype and 79 subjects with the +5466AA genotype. Baseline maximum rates of F1.2 and TAT formation and their maximum levels at the site of vascular injury, but not in venous blood, were higher in +5466G allele carriers than in those with +5466AA genotype (P&lt;0.0001). The magnitude of reduction in maximum rates of F1.2 and TAT formation following simvastatin was larger (P&lt;0.001) in +5466G allele carriers than in +5466AA subjects. The degree of decrease in maximum local levels of F1.2 and TAT after simvastatin was similar in both genotype groups. The presence of the +5466G allele was independently associated with the maximum velocity of F1.2 and TAT generation and maximum levels of both markers before and after simvastatin in multiple regression models (P&lt;0.01 for all analyses). Local thrombin generation, in +5466AG and +5466AA subjects, showed no significant correlations with lipid variables. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombin formation following vascular injury and thrombin-lowering effect of statins in patients with IHD are at least in part genetically determined by the TF +5466A&gt;G polymorphism.

19201048|t|Polymorphisms of EGFR predict clinical outcome in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with Gefitinib.
19201048|a|PURPOSE: Genetic variations in EGFR may alter protein function and therefore the therapeutic efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. This study investigated the association between polymorphisms in EGFR and clinical outcome in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with Gefitinib. METHODS: A whole gene-based tag-SNP approach was used to determine the candidate SNPs in EGFR. Four tag SNPs, one CA simple sequence repeat (CA-SSR) in intron 1, one coding region SNP (R521K), and SNPs identified by resequencing in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR were selected to analyze their association with therapeutic outcome and survival in 84 advanced NSCLC patients treated with Gefitinib. Progression-free and overall survivals were computed by Cox model adjusted for clinical factors. RESULTS: We identified two EGFR polymorphisms, rs2293347 (D994D) and CA-SSR in intron 1, associated with clinical outcome of Gefitinib therapy. The response rate for the rs2293347GG or shorter CA repeat genotype was significantly higher than that for the rs2293347GA or AA or longer CA repeat genotype (71.2% versus 37.5%, P=0.0043 and 88.5% versus 48.3%, P=0.0005). The rs2293347GG genotype was also associated with longer progression-free survival compared with the rs2293347GA or AA genotype (11 months versus 3 months, P=0.0018). A combination of rs2293347GG and shorter CA repeat genotypes had more pronounced clinical benefit. CONCLUSION: The D994D and CA-SSR polymorphisms in EGFR are potential predictors for clinical outcome in advanced NSCLC patients treated with Gefitinib.

19205682|t|Effects of CYP3A5, MDR1 and CACNA1C polymorphisms on the oral disposition and response of nimodipine in a Chinese cohort.
19205682|a|PURPOSE: Our objective was to study the effects of polymorphic the CYP3A5 (allele *1 and *3), MDR1 [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) G2677T, C3435T] and CACNA1C (SNPs rs2239128, rs2239050, rs2238032) genes on nimodipine oral disposition and response in healthy Chinese subjects. METHODS: Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data were obtained from a bioequivalence study, and the same 20 subjects were genotyped for CYP3A, MDR1 and CACNA1C. An additional 41 healthy Chinese subjects were recruited to obtain an indication of the distribution of CACNA1C polymorphisms in the Chinese population. Racial differences in the frequency of CACNA1C alleles were assessed. The phenotype differences between genotypes were analyzed. RESULTS: The allelic frequencies of rs2239050 and rs2238032 in our Chinese cohort were different from those in a Caucasian population (p &lt; 0.01). Subjects with mutant alleles (*3/*3) of the CYP3A5 gene had a decreased oral clearance of nimodipine, with a higher lnC(max) or 1n AUC(0-infinity) compared with those subjects with the heterozygote (*1/*3) or wild type (*1/*1) gene. The CACNA1C rs2239128 C and rs2239050 G SNPs were associated with a stronger efficacy compared with their respective alleles, rs2239128 T and rs2239050 C. MDR1 polymorphisms showed no significance in terms of nimodipine disposition. CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphic CYP3A5 (allele *1 and *3) and CACNA1C genes have effects on nimodipine oral disposition and response in healthy Chinese subjects. The homozygous variant of CYP3A5 (*3/*3) was associated with significantly increased nimodipine exposure. CACNA1C SNPs rs2239128 C and rs2239050 G were associated with a stronger efficacy.

19247217|t|Calcium channel blockers, NOS1AP, and heart-rate-corrected QT prolongation.
19247217|a|OBJECTIVES: To study whether NOS1AP single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs10494366 T&gt;G and rs10918594 C&gt;G, modify the heart-rate-corrected QT (QTc) prolonging effect of calcium channel blockers. BACKGROUND: Common variation in the NOS1AP gene has been associated with QT interval variation in several large population samples. NOS1 is presumed to influence intracellular calcium. METHODS: The prospective population-based Rotterdam Study includes 16 603 ECGs from 7565 participants (&gt;or=55 years), after exclusion of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, left and right bundle branch block, as well as carriers of pacemakers. The endpoint was the length of the QTc interval in calcium channel blocker users and non-users with the minor alleles compared with the major alleles (wild type). We used a repeated-measurement analysis, adjusted for all known confounders. RESULTS: Use of verapamil was associated with a significant QTc interval prolongation [6.0 ms 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7; 10.2] compared with non-users. Furthermore, users of verapamil with the rs10494366 GG genotype showed significantly more QTc prolongation than users with the TT genotype [25.4 ms (95% CI: 5.9-44.9)] (P value for multiplicative interaction 0.0038). Users of isradipine with the GG genotype showed more QTc prolongation than users with the TT genotype [19.8 ms (95% CI: 1.9-37.7)]; however, SNP rs10494366 did not modify the effect on QTc interval on a multiplicative scale (P=0.3563). SNP rs10918594 showed similar results. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we showed that the minor alleles of both NOS1AP SNPs significantly potentiate the QTc prolonging effect of verapamil.

19302829|t|Effects of the DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism on aripiprazole efficacy in schizophrenic patients as modified by clinical factors.
19302829|a|Aripiprazole, a novel antipsychotic agent, has a unique pharmacological action (partial agonist) on the dopamine neurotransmission system. Aripiprazole has high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (DRD2 and DRD3). We investigated whether the efficacy of aripiprazole can be predicted by a functional DRD3 gene polymorphism Ser9Gly (rs6280) as modified by clinical factors in Han Chinese hospitalized patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia. After hospitalization, the patients (n=128) were given aripiprazole for up to four weeks. Patients were genotyped for DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) method. Clinical factors such as gender, age, duration of illness, education level, diagnostic subtype and medication dosage were recorded. Psychopathology was measured biweekly with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The effects of genetic and clinical factors on PANSS performance after aripiprazole treatment were analyzed by a mixed model regression approach (SAS Proc MIXED). We found that, although the Ser carriers have numerically larger score reductions when compared with non-carriers in almost all PANSS dimensions, the difference of their effects are statically not significant. However, the clinical factors, including dosage of aripiprazole, age, duration of illness, and diagnostic subtype could influence PANSS performance after aripiprazole treatment. This study suggests that DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism may not contribute significantly to inter-individual differences in therapeutic efficacy of aripiprazole, but some clinical factors may predict treatment efficacy.

19303909|t|Intensity of opiate withdrawal in relation to the 825C&gt;T polymorphism of the G-protein beta 3 subunit gene.
19303909|a|OBJECTIVES: The intensity of withdrawal in opiate dependence shows a high inter-individual variability. The 825C&gt;T polymorphism (rs5443) of the G-protein beta 3 (GNB3) subunit gene has a strong influence on clinical signs of sympathetic activity in cardiac research. This study was carried out in order to test the hypothesis that carriers of the T allele have an increased sympathetic activity in opiate withdrawal. METHODS: Thirty-nine monovalent opiate addicted patients consecutively admitted to a detoxification ward were investigated. The main parameter for sympathetic activity was the pulse rate in the first 3 days after the regular end of gradual methadone reduction. RESULTS: Thirty-three out of 39 patients achieved a drug-free state: 22 carried a T allele (TT, CT), 11 belonged to the CC genotype group. The pulse rate was significantly (p&lt;0.05) raised in the T allele group compared to the CC genotype group on the first 2 days after stopping methadone administration. In addition, about a third of the T allele carriers needed clonidine treatment on the respective days, but only one patient among the 11 CC homozygotes. There was no significant difference between groups in systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as in subjective withdrawal ratings. CONCLUSION: A group difference regarding pulse rate could be observed in a small sample and despite a higher degree of concomitant clonidine medication in T allele carriers. The failure to detect group differences in blood pressure and self-rated withdrawal symptoms may be attributed to the more complex regulation of blood pressure and the known weak correlation between objective and subjective withdrawal symptoms.

19307503|t|Randomized phase II and pharmacogenetic study of pemetrexed compared with pemetrexed plus carboplatin in pretreated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
19307503|a|PURPOSE: We performed a randomized phase II trial comparing pemetrexed with pemetrexed plus carboplatin (PC) in patients experiencing relapse after platinum-based chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Main eligibility criteria were histologic or cytologic proof of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), relapse more than 3 months after platinum-based chemotherapy, normal organ function, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2. Patients were randomly assigned to pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) (arm A) or carboplatin area under the curve 5 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) (arm B), both administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Response assessment was performed every 6 weeks; toxicity assessment was performed every 3 weeks. Primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. The study was designed to detect a 33% decrease in the hazard of disease progression in the combination arm (alpha = 0.05, two-sided log-rank test). Polymorphisms of thymidylate synthase, the reduced folate carrier, gamma-glutamyl hydrolase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHF) were investigated in peripheral WBCs of consenting patients. RESULTS: Two hundred forty patients were enrolled. Median TTP was 2.8 months for arm A versus 4.2 months for arm B (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89; P = .005). Median OS was 7.6 months and 8.0 months and ORR was 4% and 9% for arms A and B, respectively. Subgroup analyses found adenocarcinoma to be associated with favorable outcome. Toxicities in both arms was negligible, with one potential toxic death in arm A. Patients with MTHFR C677T homozygous mutation had increased progression-free survival compared with patients with wild-type or heterozygous mutations (P = .03). CONCLUSION: PC as second-line treatment for relapsed NSCLC resulted in a significant 33% reduction of the hazard of disease progression as compared with pemetrexed alone.

19362955|t|DNA repair gene polymorphisms predict favorable clinical outcome in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
19362955|a|BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms of genes involved in DNA repair and glutathione metabolic pathways may affect patients' response to platinum-based chemotherapy. We retrospectively assessed whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of DNA-repair genes ERCC1, XPD, XRCC1 and glutathione S-transferase genes GSTP1, GSTT1 and GSTM1 predict overall survival (OS), response and toxicity in 119 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with platinum-based regimens as first- or second-line chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients' genotypes were determined by PCR-RFLP and sequencing approaches. RESULTS: ERCC1 (Asn118Asn) genotype was significantly associated with response to treatment. Patients with either one or two C alleles (C/C, C/T) at Asn118Asn were more likely to respond to platinum-based chemotherapy compared with those without the C allele (Odds ratio, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.013-0.828; P = .033, by binary logistic regression). There was a significant association between the ERCC1 C8092A polymorphism and OS (P = .009, by log-rank test), with median survival times of 9.8 (C/C) and 14.1 (C/A or A/A) months, respectively, suggesting that any copies of the A allele were associated with an improved outcome. Cox's multivariate analysis suggested that the joint effect of ERCC1 polymorphic variants (C8092A and N118N) (0 vs. 2, hazard ratio 2.5; 95% CI, 1.26-4.96; P = .009) as well as the XRCC1 N399Q polymorphism (AA vs. GA/GG, hazard ratio 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-6.8; P = .005) were independent prognostic factors for OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: These findings support the notion that assessment of genetic variations of ERCC1 and XRCC1 could facilitate therapeutic decisions for individualized therapy in advanced NSCLC.

19373123|t|Genetic variants altering dopamine D2 receptor expression or function modulate the risk of opiate addiction and the dosage requirements of methadone substitution.
19373123|a|AIM: Addictive behavior is importantly mediated by mesolimbic dopaminergic signaling. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the DRD2 gene locus, and in addition, the ANKK1 rs1800497C&gt;T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), formerly known as 'dopamine D2 receptor Taq1A C&gt;T polymorphism', for associations with the risk of opiate addiction and the methadone dosage requirements. METHODS: Allelic frequencies of DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphisms were compared between 85 methadone-substituted Caucasian patients and a random sample of 99 healthy Caucasian controls. Within patients, the average and maximum daily methadone dose during the first year of treatment and the time when that maximum dose was reached were analyzed for an association with DRD2/ANKK1 genetics. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, drug users carried more frequently the minor allele of DRD2 SNP rs1076560G&gt;T SNP (P=0.022, odds ratio 2.343) or the ATCT haplotype of DRD2 rs1799978A&gt;G, rs1076560G&gt;T, rs6277C&gt;T, ANKK1 rs1800497C&gt;T (P=0.048, odds ratio 2.23), with similar tendencies for ANKK1 rs1800497C&gt;T (P=0.056, odds ratio 2.12) and the TCCTCTT haplotype of DRD2 rs12364283T&gt;C, rs1799732C del, rs4648317C&gt;T, rs1076560G&gt;T, rs6275C&gt;T, rs6277C&gt;T, and ANKK1 rs1800497C&gt;T (P=0.059, odds ratio 2.31). The average and maximum daily methadone doses were significantly associated with the DRD2 rs6275C&gt;T SNP (P=0.016 and 0.005 for average and maximum dose, respectively). Carriers of the variant rs6275T allele needed higher methadone doses than noncarriers. In addition, this variant was associated with a longer time to reach the maximum methadone dose (P=0.025). CONCLUSION: On the basis of an analysis spanning the whole gene locus, from the DRD2 promoter to the ANKK1 rs1800497C&gt;T polymorphism, DRD2 genetic polymorphisms modulate both the risk of opiate addiction, leading to the necessity of methadone substitution therapy, and the course of this therapy in terms of dosage requirements.

19396436|t|Association of the DRD2 and DRD3 polymorphisms with response to pramipexole in Parkinson's disease patients.
19396436|a|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the DRD2 TaqIA and DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphisms on the efficacy of pramipexole in treating patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Thirty patients with PD prospectively received pramipexole 0.25 mg three times daily for 2 months. Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assessments were conducted at baseline and 2 months after treatment initiation. Improvement by 20% or more in the total score on the UPDRS was considered to indicate responsiveness. The PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to analyze the DRD2 Taq1A and DRD3 Ser9Gly genotype. RESULTS: The DRD2 Taq1A allele frequencies were A141.7 (A1) and 58.3% (A2), and the DRD3 Ser9Gly allele frequencies were 68.3 (Ser) and 31.7% (Gly). When the subjects were grouped by the DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism, the response rates for pramipexole treatment were significantly higher in the Ser/Ser group (60%) than in the group containing the Gly allele (13%). There was a significant association between the DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism and response rate to pramipexole in PD patients (P = 0.024). When the subjects were grouped by the DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism, there were no significant differences among the three Taq1A genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphisms are significantly associated with the therapeutic efficacy of pramipexole in Chinese patients with PD. A large-scale and multi-dose group study in patients with PD is necessary for evaluating the impact of the genetic polymorphisms of the dopamine receptor on the therapeutic effects of pramipexole.

19444285|t|Arg347Cys polymorphism of alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene is associated with blood pressure response to nifedipine GITS in Chinese hypertensive patients.
19444285|a|Our objectives were to evaluate whether polymorphisms in the alpha1A- and beta2-adrenoceptor genes influence blood pressure response to nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS). Hypertensive patients received daily treatment with an oral dosage of 30 mg nifedipine GITS for 16 days. Genotypes of the Arg347Cys polymorphism in the alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene and the Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu polymorphisms in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene were determined by TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assay. The sixteenth-day steady-state plasma concentration of nifedipine was measured using HPLC with UV detection. Multivariate linear regression was performed in a total of 447 patients to evaluate the effects of these polymorphisms on blood pressure response to nifedipine GITS. Patients carrying the Cys347 allele of the alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene had a greater systolic blood pressure reduction than did those carrying two Arg347 alleles of the alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene (32.5+/-14.0 versus 27.3+/-15.5 mm Hg, respectively, P=0.006). However, diastolic blood pressure reduction was not associated with the Arg347Cys polymorphism in the alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene. In addition, no significant associations were observed between blood pressure reduction and two polymorphisms in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene. Our data suggest that the Arg347Cys polymorphism in the alpha1A-adrenoceptor gene may be used to predict blood pressure response to nifedipine GITS in Chinese hypertensive patients.

19448608|t|Analysis of the host pharmacogenetic background for prediction of outcome and toxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP21.
19448608|a|Knowledge on the impact of pharmacogenetics in predicting outcome and toxicity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is scant. We tested 106 consecutive DLBCL treated with R-CHOP21 for 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 15 genes potentially relevant to rituximab-CHOP (R-CHOP) pharmacogenetics. Associations of SNPs with event-free survival (EFS) and toxicity were controlled for multiple testing. Genotypic variants of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) oxidase p22phox (CYBA rs4673) and alpha1 class glutathione S-transferase (GSTA1 rs3957357) were independent predictors of EFS (CYBA rs4673 TT genotype: HR 2.06, P=0.038; GSTA1 rs3957357 CT/TT genotypes: HR 0.38, P=0.003), after adjusting for International Prognostic Index (IPI). CYBA rs4673 and GSTA1 rs3957357 also predicted outcome in DLBCL subgroups by IPI. Impact of SNPs on toxicity was evaluated in 658 R-CHOP21 courses utilizing generalized estimating equations. NCF4 rs1883112 was an independent predictor against hematologic (odds ratios (OR): 0.45; P=0.018), infectious (OR: 0.46; P=0.003) and cardiac toxicity (OR: 0.37; P=0.023). Overall, host SNPs affecting doxorubicin pharmacodynamics (CYBA rs4673) and alkylator detoxification (GSTA1 rs3957357) may predict outcome in R-CHOP21-treated DLBCL. Also, NCF4 rs1883112, a SNP of NAD(P)H oxidase p40phox, may have a function in protecting against hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. These results highlight the need to improve characterization of the host genetic background for a better prognostication of DLBCL.

19590397|a|Genes that regulate the serotonin signalling system are potential targets for research in the aetiology of mood disorders and also in the treatment response of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In this study, we evaluated the association of seven serotonin signal transduction-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms [HTR1A (rs6295), HTR2A (rs6313, rs6311 and rs7997012), HTR6 (rs1805054), TPH1 (rs1800532) and TPH2 (rs1386494)] with major depressive disorder and/or treatment outcome with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients who met the criteria for major depressive disorder were treated for 6 weeks with fluoxetine, paroxetine or citalopram. The treatment response was evaluated with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and according to predefined response criteria, the patients were divided into responders, nonresponders, remitters and nonremitters. Altogether, 86 patients completed the entire study according to the study protocol. We had also a control population (N = 395) of healthy blood donors. None of the seven single nucleotide polymorphisms was associated with major depressive disorder or with treatment response in our study population of Finnish individuals.

19617864|t|Interpatient variability in IMPDH activity in MMF-treated renal transplant patients is correlated with IMPDH type II 3757T &gt; C polymorphism.
19617864|a|OBJECTIVES: The active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolic acid, inhibits the activity of the target enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). The aim of this study was to correlate eight different single nucleotide polymorphisms of the IMPDH type II gene to the activity of the IMPDH enzyme to explain between-patient differences in IMPDH activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective study, we measured IMPDH activity, mycophenolic acid plasma concentrations, and eight polymorphisms of IMPDH type II in de novo kidney transplant recipients, 6 days posttransplantation while on MMF treatment. Polymorphisms in the IMPDH type II gene were only observed for the IMPDH type II 3757T &gt; C (rs11706052) single nucleotide polymorphism. Ten of 101 patients (10%) were heterozygous and two of 101 patients (2%) homozygous for IMPDH type II 3757T &gt; C. The allele frequency was 6.9%. The IMPDH activity over 12 h (AUC(act)) was 49% higher for patients with an IMPDH type II 3757C variant [n = 12 vs. n = 68; 336 (95% confidence interval: 216-521) vs. 227 (95% confidence interval: 198-260) hmicromol/s/mol adenosine monophosphate; P = 0.04]. The IMPDH activity measured before transplantation (Act(pre-Tx)) was not significantly different between IMPDH type II 3757TT wild-type and variant carrier patients (P = 0.99). CONCLUSION: We report that the IMPDH type II 3757T &gt; C polymorphism is associated with an increased IMPDH activity in MMF-treated renal transplant patients. This polymorphism explains 8.0% of the interpatient variability in IMPDH activity.

19622037|t|The association of olanzapine-induced weight gain with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism in patients with schizophrenia.
19622037|a|Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that may cause weight gain and metabolic syndrome in some cases. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma is an important gene in the progress of type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In recent studies the polymorphism of the PPAR-gamma has been studied in type II diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, and insulin resistance syndrome. It is aimed to evaluate the association between polymorphism of PPAR-gamma gene and olanzapine-induced weight gain. Our study comprised 95 unrelated subjects who strictly met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia, and all were of Turkish origin. All patients were evaluated with rating scales, and genetic analyses were performed. We found statistically significant differences between pretreatment and posttreatment body mass index and weight change in Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPAR-gamma2. Our results suggest that genetic polymorphism of PPAR might be important in olanzapine-induced weight gain and that genetic variance of people might be considered in antipsychotic medication selection.

19636336|t|Association of a functional polymorphism in the adrenomedullin gene (ADM) with response to paroxetine.
19636336|a|To identify genes that may be relevant to the molecular action of antidepressants, we investigated transcriptional changes induced by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine in a serotonergic cell line. We examined gene expression changes after acute treatment with paroxetine and sought to validate microarray results by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Concordant transcriptional changes were confirmed for 14 genes by qPCR and five of these, including the adrenomedullin gene (Adm), either approached or reached statistical significance. Reporter gene assays showed that a SNP (rs11042725) in the upstream flanking region of ADM significantly altered expression. Association analysis demonstrated rs11042725 to be significantly associated with response to paroxetine (odds ratio=0.075, P&lt;0.001) but not with response to either fluoxetine or citalopram. Our results suggest that ADM is involved with the therapeutic efficacy of paroxetine, which may have pharmacogenetic utility.

19644963|t|Association of a variant in the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 gene (CHRM2) with nicotine addiction.
19644963|a|Genetic factors contribute to the overall risk of developing nicotine addiction, which is the major cause of preventable deaths in western countries. However, knowledge regarding specific polymorphisms influencing smoking phenotypes remains scarce. In the present study we provide evidence that a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5' untranslated region of CHRM2, the gene coding for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 is associated with nicotine addiction. CHRM2 was defined as a candidate gene for nicotine addiction based on previous evidence that linked variations in CHRM2 to alcohol and drug dependence. A total of more than 5,500 subjects representative of the German population were genotyped and assessed regarding their smoking habits. The impact of three SNPs in CHRM2 on smoking behavior/nicotine addiction was investigated using logistic regression models or a quasi-Poisson regression model, respectively. We found the T allele of SNP rs324650 to be associated with an increased risk of smoking/nicotine dependence according to three different models, the recessive models of regular or heavy smokers vs. never-smokers (odds ratio 1.17 in both analyses) and according to the Fagerstrom index of nicotine addiction. In the analysis stratified by gender this association was only found in females. Our data provide further evidence that variations in CHRM2 may be associated with the genetic risk of addiction in general or with certain personality traits that predispose to the development of addiction. Alternatively, variations in CHRM2 could modulate presynaptic auto-regulation in cholinergic systems and may thereby affect an individual's response to nicotine more specifically.

19747927|t|Serotonin 1A receptor gene is associated with Japanese methamphetamine-induced psychosis patients.
19747927|a|BACKGROUND: Several investigations have reported associations the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor to schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, making 5-HT1A receptor gene (HTR1A) an adequate candidate gene for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis. Huang and colleagues reported that rs6295 in HTR1A was associated with schizophrenia. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. It may indicate that METH-induced psychosis and schizophrenia have common susceptibility genes. In support of this hypothesis, we reported that the V-act murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1 (AKT1) gene was associated with METH-induced psychosis and schizophrenia in the Japanese population. Furthermore, we conducted an analysis of the association of HTR1A with METH-induced psychosis. METHOD: Using one functional SNP (rs6295) and one tagging SNP (rs878567), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients. RESULTS: Rs878567 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. Moreover, this significance remained after Bonferroni correction. In addition, we detected an association between rs6295 and rs878567 in HTR1A and METH-induced psychosis patients in the haplotype-wise analysis. Although we detected an association between rs6295 and METH-induced psychosis patients, this significance disappeared after Bonferroni correction. CONCLUSION: HTR1A may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced psychosis in the Japanese population. However, because we did not perform a mutation scan of HTR1A, a replication study using a larger sample may be required for conclusive results.

19842932|t|Association between ABCC2 polymorphism and lopinavir accumulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-infected patients.
19842932|a|AIM: Lopinavir (LPV) is a potent protease inhibitor used in combination with low doses of ritonavir in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. LPV pharmacokinetics is characterized by a large interindividual variability requiring the use of therapeutic drug monitoring in different clinical situations. While the sources of this variability are still unknown, several genetic polymorphisms in biotransformation enzymes or transporter proteins involved in the metabolism and/or the distribution of LPV appear as good candidates. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of selected genetic polymorphisms on LPV trough plasma concentrations ([LPV](Cmin)), LPV concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ([LPV](CC)) and the LPV accumulation ratio ([LPV](CC):[LPV](Cmin)). MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: A total of 53 patients receiving Kaletra((R)) (Abbott Laboratories, IL, USA) (LPV+ritonavir) were genotyped for 14 different polymorphisms in biotransformation enzymes and transporter proteins. [LPV](Cmin), [LPV](CC) and [LPV](CC):[LPV](Cmin) were compared according to the patient's genotypes. RESULTS &amp; CONCLUSION: The 4544G&gt;A (rs8187710)polymorphism in ABCC2 was associated with a higher accumulation of LPV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-treated patients. As already observed in previous studies, ABCB1 or CYP3A5 polymorphisms had no impact on [LPV](Cmin) and we did not detect any influence of these polymorphisms on [LPV](CC) and its accumulation in mononuclear cells. In conclusion, this pilot study suggests, for the first time, that the 4544G&gt;A polymorphism in ABCC2 could explain a significant part of the interindividual variability in LPV pharmacokinetics. Further investigations are needed to confirm this association and to explore its real pharmacodynamic impact.

19842935|t|Different effects of the ABCG2 c.421C&gt;A SNP on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin.
19842935|a|AIMS: This study aimed to investigate possible effects of the ABCG2 c.421C&gt;A (p.Gln141Lys; rs2231142) genotype on fluvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin pharmacokinetics. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: In a crossover study, five healthy volunteers with the ABCG2 c.421A/A genotype, four with the c.421C/A genotype and 23 with the c.421C/C genotype ingested a single 40-mg dose of fluvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin, with a washout period of 1 week. Plasma statin concentrations were measured up to 12 h. RESULTS: The estimated marginal mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) of fluvastatin was 97% (p = 0.015) or 72% (p = 0.009) larger in participants with the A/A genotype than in those with the C/A or C/C genotype. The AUC(0-infinity) of simvastatin lactone was 111% (p = 0.005) larger in participants with the A/A genotype than in participants with the C/C genotype. The simvastatin acid:lactone AUC(0-infinity) ratio was 46% (p = 0.017) smaller in individuals with the A/A genotype than in those with the C/C genotype. The ABCG2 genotype had no significant effect on simvastatin acid or pravastatin pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variability in ABCG2 markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin and simvastatin lactone, but has no significant effect on pravastatin or active simvastatin acid. Genotyping for ABCG2 in addition to SLCO1B1 and ABCB1 polymorphisms could help in predicting statin pharmacokinetics when selecting a statin and its dose for an individual patient.

19893579|t|No influence of FAT polymorphisms in response to aripiprazole.
19893579|a|The aim of this study was to investigate possible influences of a set of markers in the FAT gene (rs2306987, rs2306990, rs2637777 and rs2304865) on efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenic patients. Efficacy was assessed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 using the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement scale (CGI-S; CGI-I), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms scale. Side effects were evaluated by means of the Simpson-Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms, the Barnes Akathisia Scale and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Multivariate analyses were employed to test possible influences of single nucleotide polymorphisms on clinical and safety variables. Analysis of haplotypes was also performed. No relevant association between FAT variants and clinical or safety scores was observed. Haplotype analysis did not reveal any significant association with clinical and safety scores at any time as well. Our data suggest no association between investigated alleles and genotypes in FAT and response to aripiprazole. However, because several limitations characterize the present study, further investigations on larger studies are required.

20022809|t|Gefitinib versus cisplatin plus docetaxel in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (WJTOG3405): an open label, randomised phase 3 trial.
20022809|a|BACKGROUND: Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene respond well to the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. However, whether gefitinib is better than standard platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients selected by EGFR mutation is uncertain. METHODS: We did an open label, phase 3 study (WJTOG3405) with recruitment between March 31, 2006, and June 22, 2009, at 36 centres in Japan. 177 chemotherapy-naive patients aged 75 years or younger and diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer or postoperative recurrence harbouring EGFR mutations (either the exon 19 deletion or L858R point mutation) were randomly assigned, using a minimisation technique, to receive either gefitinib (250 mg/day orally; n=88) or cisplatin (80 mg/m(2), intravenously) plus docetaxel (60 mg/m(2), intravenously; n=89), administered every 21 days for three to six cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Survival analysis was done with the modified intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with UMIN (University Hospital Medical Information Network in Japan), number 000000539. FINDINGS: Five patients were excluded (two patients were found to have thyroid and colon cancer after randomisation, one patient had an exon 18 mutation, one patient had insufficient consent, and one patient showed acute allergic reaction to docetaxel). Thus, 172 patients (86 in each group) were included in the survival analyses. The gefitinib group had significantly longer progression-free survival compared with the cisplatin plus docetaxel goup, with a median progression-free survival time of 9.2 months (95% CI 8.0-13.9) versus 6.3 months (5.8-7.8; HR 0.489, 95% CI 0.336-0.710, log-rank p&lt;0.0001). Myelosuppression, alopecia, and fatigue were more frequent in the cisplatin plus docetaxel group, but skin toxicity, liver dysfunction, and diarrhoea were more frequent in the gefitinib group. Two patients in the gefitinib group developed interstitial lung disease (incidence 2.3%), one of whom died. INTERPRETATION: Patients with lung cancer who are selected by EGFR mutations have longer progression-free survival if they are treated with gefitinib than if they are treated with cisplatin plus docetaxel.

20116071|t|Genetic association of the GDNF alpha-receptor genes with schizophrenia and clozapine response.
20116071|a|GDNF (glial-cell-line derived neurotrophic factor) is a potent neurotrophic factor for dopaminergic neurons. Neuropsychiatric diseases and their treatments are associated with alterations in the levels of both GDNF and its receptor family (GDNF family receptor alpha or GFRA). GFRA1, GFRA2 and GFRA3 are located in chromosomal regions with suggestive linkage to schizophrenia. In this study we analyzed polymorphisms located in all four known GFRA genes and examined association with schizophrenia and clozapine response. We examined SNPs across the genes GFRA1-4 in 219 matched case-control subjects, 85 small nuclear families and 140 schizophrenia patients taking clozapine for 6months. We observed that GFRA3 rs11242417 and GFRA1 rs11197557 variants were significantly associated with schizophrenia after combining results from both schizophrenia samples. Furthermore, we found an overtransmission of the G-C GFRA1 rs7920934-rs730357 haplotype to subjects with schizophrenia and association of A-T-G-G GFRA3 rs10036665-rs10952-rs11242417-rs7726580 with schizophrenia in the case-control sample. On the other hand, GFRA2 variants were not associated with schizophrenia diagnosis but subjects carrying T-G-G rs1128397-rs13250096-rs4567028 haplotype were more likely to respond to clozapine treatment. The statistical significance of results survived permutation testing but not Bonferroni correction. We also found nominally-significant evidence for interactions between GFRA1, 2 and 3 associated with schizophrenia and clozapine response, consistent with the locations of these three genes within linkage regions for schizophrenia.

20231857|t|Why do young women smoke? VI. A controlled study of nicotine effects on attention: pharmacogenetic interactions.
20231857|a|In prior studies we found that young, female smokers manifest poorer performance than non-smokers on attention-related tasks and that these findings can be moderated by variation in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) genes. We predicted that under controlled conditions (1) nicotine would improve functioning on attentional tasks in smokers who previously manifested relatively poor performance, and that (2) smokers who carry genetic variations associated with poorer attention performance would derive greater benefit from nicotine. To test these hypotheses, 31 young female smokers, who participated in our previous study, performed the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT), Tower of London Test and Continuous Performance Task (CPT) in a double-blind, within-between subject design, placebo or nicotine (4 mg as gum) serving as the within factor and genetic profile as the between factor. Repeated measures ANCOVA controlling for attention deficit symptomatology, substance abuse and nicotine dependence showed better performance under nicotine among participants with higher levels of attention deficit symptoms (MFFT errors: P=0.04; CPT commissions: P=0.01) and nicotine dependence (CPT stability of response: P=0.04) and greater consumption of caffeine (CPT stability of response: P=0.04). An interactive effect of genetic profile was demonstrated for SNP rs2337980 in CHRNA7. These findings suggest that nicotine may have stronger short-term facilitating effects on attention in women who have more attention deficit symptoms and consume more nicotine and caffeine. This effect may be modified by a specific genetic make-up. Such individuals may be at increased risk for nicotine addiction and for greater difficulties in smoking cessation.

20348464|t|Nuclear receptor rev-erb-{alpha} circadian gene variants and lithium carbonate prophylaxis in bipolar affective disorder.
20348464|a|Rev-erb-alpha is one of the key components of the mammalian circadian mechanism; recently, it was also reported to be involved in the biological action of lithium. We investigated whether polymorphisms in the Rev-erb- alpha gene are associated with the long-term efficacy of lithium carbonate therapy in bipolar affective disorder. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in a well-characterized sample of patients from Sardinia, Italy, who were followed prospectively for up to 27 years. Genotypic and allelic analysis did not show evidence for association between the polymorphisms and the different levels of lithium response. Further analyses grouping the different levels of response demonstrated that when the patients were separated into groups of nonresponders versus individuals who have had at least a minor or modest improvement in frequency of episodes or admissions, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the T allele in the nonresponder group (p = 0.0008). Logistic regression analyses showed that patients carrying at least one copy of the T allele for the rs2314339 marker were shown to be approximately 3.5 times more likely to have no improvement or even a worsening of the illness (odds ratio [OR], 3.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-10.76). The results of this study may help to identify potential biological markers that can serve to predict the response of bipolar affective disorder patients to treatment, improving treatment efficacy.

20352314|t|Role of beta-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms in the long-term effects of beta-blockade with carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure.
20352314|a|BACKGROUND: Beta-blockers are mainstay of current treatment of heart failure (HF). Beta-adrenergic receptors (AR) single nucleotide gene polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence the sensitivity and density of beta-AR. We assessed the relation between three common beta-AR SNPs and the response to carvedilol administration. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 183 consecutive patients with chronic HF due to ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, a LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; or = 0.35, not previously treated with beta-blockers. Each patient underwent gated-SPECT radionuclide ventriculography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and invasive hemodynamic monitoring at baseline and after 12 months of carvedilol administration at maintenance dosages. The beta1-AR gene Arg389Gly and the beta2-AR gene Arg16Gly SNPs were not related to the response to carvedilol administration. Homozygotes for the Glu27Glu allele showed a greater increase in the LVEF, compared to the other patients (+13.0 +/- 12.2% versus +7.1 +/- 8.1% in the Gln27Gln homozygotes, and 8.3 +/- 11.4% units in the Gln27Glu heterozygotes; p = 0.022 by ANOVA). Glu27Glu homozygotes also showed a greater decline in the pulmonary wedge pressure both at rest and at peak exercise. Gln27Glu SNP was selected amongst the determinants of the LVEF response to carvedilol at multivariable analysis, in addition to the cause of cardiomyopathy, baseline systolic blood pressure and the dose of carvedilol administered. CONCLUSION: Beta1-AR Arg389Gly and beta2-AR Arg16Gly SNPs are not related to the response to carvedilol therapy. In contrast, the Gln27Glu SNP is a determinant of the LVEF response to this agent in patients with chronic HF.

20362026|t|Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) gene in the comorbidity of schizophrenia with alcohol use disorders and nicotine dependence.
20362026|a|Studies have shown a genetic susceptibility to develop schizophrenia, alcohol use disorders and nicotine dependence. Brain areas related to reward and reinforcement show high expression of the cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). Nicotine and alcohol are also able to modulate CART expression in the hypothalamic areas. In this study, we evaluated whether CART variants would influence the predisposition of schizophrenia subjects to alcohol use disorders and nicotine dependence. Clinical and genetic data were obtained from 190 unrelated Caucasian schizophrenia subjects collected at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. We found no association of CART variants with alcohol use disorders or nicotine dependence. We found a trend for allelic association of rs11575893 with the heaviness of smoking behaviour (p=0.057). Our results indicate that genetic variants in the CART gene may not play a major role in the vulnerability of schizophrenia subjects to concurrent alcohol use disorders and nicotine dependence. Additional association studies in independent samples can evaluate whether CART gene is playing a role in the schizophrenia comorbidity with alcohol use disorders and nicotine dependence.

20417680|t|Absence of a general association between ABCB1 genetic variants and response to antiepileptic drugs in epilepsy patients.
20417680|a|Over-expression of efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (PgP) encoded by ABCB1 gene has been implicated in poor responsive epilepsy. Several genetic variants have been shown to influence the expression levels of P-glycoprotein. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ABCB1 polymorphisms: C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T in determining drug response to first line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) namely phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate in North Indian cohort of epilepsy patients. DNA samples were obtained from 392 consecutive epilepsy patients, out of which 228 had completed follow-up evaluation at 12 months. After attaining steady state of the AEDs in the first two months of study, 133 patients showed complete freedom from seizures (no-seizure group) and 95 patients continued to have seizures (recurrent-seizures group) in the remaining period of study. Comparison of "no-seizure" and "recurrent-seizures" groups revealed no significant differences in allelic, genotypic and haplotypic frequencies for all the studied variants. In conclusion, our finding disproves a general association between ABCB1 polymorphisms and drug response in epilepsy patients.

20436376|t|A single-nucleotide polymorphism of alanine to threonine at position 163 of the human angiotensin II type 1 receptor impairs Losartan affinity.
20436376|a|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: AT1 is the principal receptor for angiotensin II (AngII), which regulates blood pressure and osmotic homeostasis. Earlier studies have shown that position 163 interacts with the antihypertensive nonpeptide antagonist, Losartan. A recently discovered polymorphism found in humans (rs12721226) coding for residue 163 led us to determine whether this polymorphism would affect Losartan antihypertensive therapies. The pharmacological properties of the A163T hAT1 variant are described. METHOD AND RESULTS: The A163T hAT1 mutation was evaluated by testing its affinity by dose displacement of AngII analogs in COS-7 cells expressing either wild-type hAT1 or the A163T hAT1. The expressions of the receptors were evaluated by saturation binding and the efficacies were assessed by measuring the 3H-inositol phosphate production. The results showed that the A163T hAT1 receptor is comparable with the affinity, expression, and efficacy of native hAT1 towards peptide ligands. The affinities were also tested with nonpeptide antagonists Losartan, L-158 809, valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan, candesartan, and EXP3174. Losartan and EXP3174 displayed a 7-fold loss in affinity towards A163T hAT1. The ability of Losartan to inhibit AngII-induced inositol triphosphate production also confirmed a loss in efficacy. Molecular modeling showed a higher steric and hydrophilic hindrance of the A163T hAT1-Losartan complex. CONCLUSION: The polymorphism that codes for the A163T hAT1 variant results in a receptor with normal physiological properties toward the endogenous hormone. However, the significant reduction in affinity to Losartan and its active metabolite, EXP3174, could significantly impair the clinical effectiveness of an antihypertensive therapy using Losartan with patients bearing the A163T polymorphism.

20452607|t|Influence of serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms on clozapine response in Brazilian schizophrenics.
20452607|a|Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness affecting around 1% of adults with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. Affected individuals are at increased risk for unemployment, handicap, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hearth attack and suicide. Antipsychotic drugs are the best treatment for this disease, but about 20% of patients display drug resistance, or refractoriness, and may receive a special neuroleptic named Clozapine. Despite its superiority from other neuroleptics, only 30-60% of drug-resistant patients are responsive to clozapine. Clozapine's action results from interactions between dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems and since clozapine appears to exert its effect strongly through the serotonergic systems, alterations in serotonin synaptic levels may influence antipsychotic response. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is responsible for pre-synaptic re-uptake of serotonin, making this transporter a logical candidate gene for prediction of clozapine response and to increase understanding about mechanisms of refractoriness. Therefore, we investigated the influence of two polymorphisms in the 5-HTT gene (HTTLPR/rs25531 and VNTR Stin2) in clozapine response in a sample of 116 schizophrenic individuals of European descent from South-Brazil. Significant differences between responders and non-responders to clozapine were observed for the HTTLPR/rs25531 polymorphism. Nonresponders to clozapine showed a higher frequency of S'-allele (P = 0.01) and also were more likely to be S'/S' homozygous or S'/L' heterozygous than those who did respond (P = 0.04). After controlling for confounding variables, logistic regression analyses confirmed this association (OR = 3.15; 95% CI: 1.13-8.80). The observed association suggests that increased availability of extracellular serotonin concentrations at all synapses may reduce clozapine effect.

20514076|t|beta-Arrestin2 influences the response to methadone in opioid-dependent patients.
20514076|a|beta-Arrestin2 (ARRB2) is a component of the G-protein-coupled receptor complex and is involved in mu-opioid and dopamine D(2) receptor signaling, two central processes in methadone signal transduction. We analyzed 238 patients in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and identified a haplotype block (rs34230287, rs3786047, rs1045280 and rs2036657) spanning almost the entire ARRB2 locus. Although none of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) leads to a change in amino-acid sequence, we found that for all the SNPs analyzed, with exception of rs34230287, homozygosity for the variant allele confers a nonresponding phenotype (n=73; rs1045280C and rs2036657G: OR=3.1, 95% CI=1.5-6.3, P=0.004; rs3786047A: OR=2.5, 95% CI=1.2-5.1, P=0.02) also illustrated by a 12-fold shorter period of negative urine screening (P=0.01). The ARRB2 genotype may thus contribute to the interindividual variability in the response to MMT and help to predict response to treatment.

20631561|t|Endocannabinoid Pro129Thr FAAH functional polymorphism but not 1359G/A CNR1 polymorphism is associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain.
20631561|a|Several candidate genes have been associated with antipsychotic-induced body weight (BW) gain. Because the endocannabinoid system is deeply involved in BW regulation, endocannabinoid genes may have a role in the antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Therefore, we investigated the 1359 G/A (rs1049353) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) gene, which codes the endocannabinoid CB1 receptor, and the complementary DNA (cDNA) 385C/A (rs324420) SNP of the FAAH gene, which codes the endocannabinoid degrading enzyme, for their role in BW changes induced by antipsychotic drugs. Eighty-three white psychotic patients who underwent a naturalistic treatment with different antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and haloperidol) and completed a 24-week treatment period were included into the study together with 80 age- and sex-matched white healthy controls. At the 24th week of treatment, 41 patients gained more than 7% of their baseline BW. No significant differences between patients and controls emerged in genotype and allele frequencies of both SNPs. Genotype and allele frequencies of the FAAH cDNA 385C/A SNP but not of the CNR1 1359 G/A SNP significantly differed between subjects who gained more than 7% of BW and those who did not, with both AC and AA genotypes and the A allele being significantly more frequent in patients who gained more than 7% of their baseline BW. Present findings, although obtained in a small population and in a naturalistic setting, suggest that the cDNA 385C/A SNP of the FAAH gene may predispose subjects to get a clinically meaningful weight gain after antipsychotic exposure.

20732371|t|Association study of polymorphisms in cholecystokinin gene and its receptors with antipsychotic induced weight gain in schizophrenia patients.
20732371|a|Cholecystokinin (CCK) gene and its receptors play an important role in several biological processes including satiety signaling. Administration of exogenous or endogenously secreted CCK leads to decreased food intake in both rats and humans. Similarly, in rats pretreated with intraperitoneal CCK, antagonists of the CCKA receptor prevent decrease in food intake. The CCKB receptor plays an important role in anxiety and gastric acid secretion. We investigated the role of polymorphisms in the CCK gene (2 SNPs) and its receptors CCKA (4 SNPs) and CCKB (4SNPs, 1 microsatellite, CTn) in antipsychotic induced weight gain (n=215). Weight change (%) from baseline was compared across genotypic groups using analysis of covariance. In the European ancestry patients treated with clozapine or olanzapine a trend of association was observed with the SNP rs2929183 (p=0.10) in CCKBR gene. Carriers of the genotype AA (3.23%+-4.8) gained less weight than the AG and GG genotypes (6.50%+-6.5; p=0.035). A similar trend was observed for the CTn repeat, where carriers of the LL genotype gained less weight (3.73%+-5.41) than the S allele carrying genotypes (6.29%+-6.2, p=0.05). In the subjects of African ancestry we observed similar marginal association although with the opposite allele. However, none of these observations would survive corrections for multiple testing. None of the other polymorphisms in either CCK or CCKA receptor genes was associated with weight change (%). In conclusion, CCKB receptor gene may play a role in antipsychotic induced weight gain. However, these observations need to be replicated in a larger and independent sample set.

20809084|t|Association analysis of SLC30A8 rs13266634 and rs16889462 polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes mellitus and repaglinide response in Chinese patients.
20809084|a|OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified that SLC30A8 genetic polymorphism was a risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in several populations. This study aimed to investigate whether the SLC30A8 rs13266634 and rs16889462 polymorphisms were associated with T2DM susceptibility and repaglinide therapeutic efficacy in Chinese T2DM patients. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 443 T2DM patients and 229 healthy volunteers to identify SLC30A8 rs13266634 and rs16889462 genotypes by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Forty-eight patients were randomly selected and underwent an 8-week repaglinide treatment (3 mg/d). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbAlc), fasting serum insulin (FINS), postprandial serum insulin (PINS), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) were determined before and after repaglinide treatment. RESULTS: SLC30A8 rs13266634 risk C allele frequency was higher in T2DM patients than in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05). There was a better repaglinide response on FINS (P &lt; 0.05) and PINS (P &lt; 0.01) in patients with rs13266634 CT+TT genotypes compared with CC genotype carriers. Patients with rs16889462 GA genotype showed an enhanced repaglinide efficacy on FPG (P &lt; 0.01), PPG (P &lt; 0.01) and HbAlc (P &lt; 0.05) compared with GG genotype individuals. CONCLUSIONS: SLC30A8 rs13266634 and rs16889462 polymorphisms were associated with repaglinide therapeutic efficacy in Chinese T2DM patients.

20829635|t|No influence of DTNBP1 polymorphisms on the response to aripiprazole.
20829635|a|AIMS: The aim of the present study was to investigate possible influences of a panel of markers in the dysbindin gene DTNBP1 (rs3213207, rs1011313, rs2005976, rs760761 and rs2619522) on the clinical outcome and side effects associated to the treatment with aripiprazole in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: Efficacy was assessed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 using the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement Scales, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Side effects were evaluated by the Simpson-Angus, Barnes Akathisia and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scales. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to test possible influences of single nucleotide polymorphisms on clinical and safety scores. Analysis of haplotypes was also performed. RESULTS: No relevant association between DTNBP1 variants and clinical or safety scores was observed. Additionally, haplotype analysis did not reveal any significant association with clinical and safety scores at any time as well. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest no association between the investigated alleles and genotypes in DTNBP1 and the response to aripiprazole. However, because several limitations characterize the present study, further investigations are required.

20837989|t|Naturally occurring variants of human aldo-keto reductases with reduced in vitro metabolism of daunorubicin and doxorubicin.
20837989|a|Doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DAUN) are effective anticancer drugs; however, considerable interpatient variability exists in their pharmacokinetics. This may be caused by altered metabolism by nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (ns-SNPs) in genes encoding aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) and carbonyl reductases. This study examined the effect of 27 ns-SNPs, in eight human genes, on the in vitro metabolism of both drugs to their major metabolites, doxorubicinol and daunorubicinol. Kinetic assays measured metabolite levels by high-performance liquid chromatography separation with fluorescence detection using purified, histidine-tagged, human wild-type, and variant enzymes. Maximal rate of activity (V(max)), substrate affinity (K(m)), turnover rate (k(cat)), and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) were determined. With DAUN as substrate, variants for three genes exhibited significant differences in these parameters compared with their wild-type counterparts: the A106T, R170C, and P180S variants significantly reduced metabolism compared with the AKR1C3 wild-type (V(max), 23-47% decrease; k(cat), 22-47%; k(cat)/K(m), 38-44%); the L311V variant of AKR1C4 significantly decreased V(max) (47% lower) and k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) (both 43% lower); and the A142T variant of AKR7A2 significantly affected all kinetic parameters (V(max) and k(cat), 61% decrease; K(m), 156% increase; k(cat)/K(m), 85% decrease). With DOX, the R170C and P180S variants of AKR1C3 showed significantly reduced V(max) (41-44% decrease), k(cat) (39-45%), and k(cat)/K(m) (52-69%), whereas the A142T variant significantly altered all kinetic parameters for AKR7A2 (V(max), 41% decrease; k(cat), 44% decrease; K(m), 47% increase; k(cat)/K(m), 60% decrease). These findings suggest that ns-SNPs in human AKR1C3, AKR1C4, and AKR7A2 significantly decrease the in vitro metabolism of DOX and DAUN.

20859245|t|Glutamatergic gene variants impact the clinical profile of efficacy and side effects of haloperidol.
20859245|a|BACKGROUND: The glutamatergic system may be relevant to the pathophysiology of psychosis and to the effects of antipsychotic treatments. OBJECTIVES: We investigated a set of 62 SNPs located in genes coding for subunits of glutamatergic receptors (GAD1, GRIA1, GRIA3, GRIA4, GRID2, GRIK1, GRIK2, GRIK3, GRIK4, GRIN2B, GRM1 and GRM4), and the transporter of glycine (SLC6A5), as modulators of the effects of haloperidol. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied a sample of 101 acutely ill psychotic patients. We then validated our result in two independent samples from Slovenia (n=71 and n=118) of schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics. We both investigated the antipsychotic effect (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and motor side effect (Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale) at baseline and days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. SLC6A5 variant (rs2298826) was found to be associated with a rapid rise of motor side effects at the beginning of the treatment (repeated measures of analysis of variance, P=0.0002), followed by a subsequent adaptation, probably dependent on haloperidol doses down titration. A specific effect was noted for dyskinetic symptoms. Haplotype analysis strengthened the relevance of SLC6A5: the C-A-C haplotype (rs1443548, rs883377, rs1945771) was found to be associated with higher Extrapyramidal symptom rating scale scores (overall P=0.01, haplotype P=0.000001). We successfully replicated this finding in the two independent samples from Slovenia. CONCLUSION: This result further stresses the relevance of the glutamatergic system in modulating the effects of haloperidol treatment, especially with regards to motor side effects.

20887379|t|Tumour necrosis factor haplotypes associated with sensory neuropathy in Asian and Caucasian human immunodeficiency virus patients.
20887379|a|In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, neuropathy is a common adverse side effect to some antiretroviral treatments, particularly stavudine. As stavudine is cheap, it is widely used in Asia and Africa. We showed that increasing age and height moderately predict the development of neuropathy. This was improved by the inclusion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-1031 (rs1799964). To investigate this association, Malay (n = 64), Chinese (n = 74) and Caucasian patients (n = 37) exposed to stavudine were screened for neuropathy. DNA samples were genotyped for polymorphisms in the central major histocompatibility complex (MHC) near TNF, and haplotypes were derived. The haplotype group FVa6,7,8 (incorporating TNF-1031) was found to be associated with neuropathy in Chinese patients in bivariate analyses (P = 0.03), and in Malays and Chinese in a multivariate analysis correcting for age and height (P = 0.02, P = 0.03, respectively). This trend was also confirmed in Caucasians.

20925579|a|OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate whether CYP2D6 polymorphisms were associated with the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect and systemic complications (especially bradycardia) of ophthalmic timolol. METHODS: One hundred twenty-three primary open-angle glaucoma subjects (123 eyes) were treated with 0.5% aqueous formulations of ophthalmic timolol. IOP and heart rate were measured before and after timolol administration. DNA was extracted from venous leukocytes of all the subjects. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP2D6, for example, rs16947 (2850C&gt;T, R296C) and rs1135840 (4180C&gt;G, S486T), were detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: Neither rs16947 (P = 0.339) nor rs1135840 (P = 0.903) genotype was statistically correlated with the IOP-lowering effect of timolol eye drops. The rs16947 genotype was significantly associated with occurrence of bradycardia in primary open-angle glaucoma patients (P = 0.021). The patients with rs16947 CT (P = 0.043) or TT (P = 0.043) were more inclined to bradycardia than those with rs16947 CC, although there was no significant difference between CT and TT (P = 0.177). The analysis of variance showed no significant difference in heart rate (P = 0.559) among GG, GC, and CC groups. CONCLUSIONS: CYP2D6 SNP rs16947 may confer susceptibility to timolol-induced bradycardia. Patients with CC genotype were unlikely to suffer from timolol-induced bradycardia, whereas those with TT genotype were found to suffer from timolol-induced bradycardia.

20938339|t|Temozolomide-induced severe myelosuppression: analysis of clinically associated polymorphisms in two patients.
20938339|a|Genotyping of putative determinants of temozolomide (TMZ)-induced life-threatening bone marrow suppression was performed in two patients with glioma treated with adjuvant TMZ and radiation therapy. DNA was extracted from the patients' mononuclear cells and genotyping of O-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), multidrug resistance (MDR1; also known as ABCB1), NQO1, and GSTP1 genes and analysis for the epigenetic silencing of specific MGMT gene promoters were carried out to evaluate the possible genetic determinants of increased risk of severe TMZ-induced myelosuppression. Although both patients were heterozygous for all ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms and for rs12917 and rs1803965 in the MGMT gene, patient 1 was heterozygous for rs1695 in GSTP1 and rs2308327 in the MGMT gene. This patient also exhibited GG genotype for the MGMT single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs2308321, which is noteworthy for its 0.7% frequency globally. Epigenetic silencing of MGMT gene was not detected in either patient. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in patient 1 (missense I143V and K178R polymorphisms; rs2308321 and rs2308327, respectively) have recently been shown to correlate with an increased risk of severe TMZ-induced myelosuppression. The polymorphisms identified in patient 2 have not been associated with an increased risk of severe TMZ-induced myelosuppression. Genotyping analyses of larger patient populations administered TMZ are required to validate the genetic determinants of severe TMZ-induced myelosuppression.

20938465|t|Association of ABCB1 polymorphisms with survival and in vitro cytotoxicty in de novo acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype.
20938465|a|Overexpression of the multi-drug transporter P-glycoprotein, encoded by the ABCB1 gene, is a clinically relevant problem in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Polymorphisms in ABCB1 might contribute to cancer risk and therapeutic response. We therefore investigated the influence of polymorphisms G1199A, C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T on cancer susceptibility, in vitro cytotoxicity and overall survival in 100 de novo AML patients with normal karyotype. Patients with 1236C/C or 2677G/G genotypes showed poorer survival than patients with other genotypes (P=0.03 and P=0.02, respectively). Both these genotypes were significant factors for survival in multivariate analysis, along with age, NPM1 and FLT3 mutation status. In vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that leukemic cells from 1236T/T and 2677T/T patients were significantly more susceptible to mitoxantrone (P=0.02), and tended to be more susceptible to etoposide and daunorubicin (P=0.07-0.09), but not to cytarabine. No significant difference in allele frequencies was found between patients and healthy volunteers (n=400).

21052022|t|A functional variant of the NEDD4L gene is associated with beneficial treatment response with beta-blockers and diuretics in hypertensive patients.
21052022|a|OBJECTIVE: The capability of the protein NEDD4L to reduce renal tubular expression of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is influenced by a functional rs4149601 G A NEDD4L polymorphism. As diuretics and beta-blockers inhibit renal sodium reabsorption and renin release, respectively, we hypothesized that the beta-blocker or diuretic-induced blood pressure reduction and prevention of cardiovascular disease would be greater in patients with the highest ENaC expression (rs4149601 G-allele), whereas there would be no such genetically mediated differences in treatment efficacy among patients treated with the vasodilator diltiazem. METHODS: We related rs4149601 status to 6-month blood pressure reduction and risk of cardiovascular events in 5152 hypertensive patients (DBP &gt;= 100 mmHg) from the Nordic Diltiazem Study (NORDIL) randomized to either beta-blocker and/or diuretic-based treatment or diltiazem-based treatment. RESULTS: In patients on beta-blocker or diuretic monotherapy, carriers of the G-allele had greater SBP reduction (19.5 +- 16.8 vs. 15.0 +- 19.3 mmHg, P &lt; 0.001) and DBP reduction (15.4 +- 8.3vs. 14.1 +- 8.4 mmHg, P = 0.02) and during 4.5 years of follow-up among patients randomized to beta-blockers and/or diuretics, carriers of the G-allele had greater protection from cardiovascular events [relative risk (RR) = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.36-0.74, P &lt; 0.001] as compared to AA homozygotes. Within the diltiazem group, there was no difference in blood pressure reduction or risk of cardiovascular events according to genotype. CONCLUSION: The functional NEDD4L rs4149601 polymorphism influences the efficacy of beta-blocker and/or diuretic-based antihypertensive treatment both in terms of blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular disease protection, whereas diltiazem-based antihypertensive treatment efficacy is not influenced by this NEDD4L polymorphism.

21063236|t|Dependency of phenprocoumon dosage on polymorphisms in the VKORC1, CYP2C9, and CYP4F2 genes.
21063236|a|BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on warfarin and acenocoumarol showed that interindividual dosage variation is mainly associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VKORC1 and to a lesser extent in CYP2C9 and CYP4F2. For phenprocoumon dosage, the genes encoding CYP3A4 and ApoE might play a role. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between common genetic variants within VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, CYP3A4, and ApoE and phenprocoumon maintenance dosage, and to identify novel signals using GWAS. METHODS: We selected all participants from the Rotterdam study who were treated with phenprocoumon. For each SNP, we tested the association between the above-mentioned genotypes and age, sex, body mass index, and target INR adjusted-phenprocoumon maintenance dosage. RESULTS: Within our study population (N=244), VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2 genotypes together explained 46% of phenprocoumon maintenance dosage variation. Each additional VKORC1 variant allele reduced phenprocoumon maintenance dosage by 4.8 mg/week (P&lt;0.0001) and each additional CYP2C9 variant allele by 2.2 mg/week (P=0.002). Each additional variant allele of CYP4F2 increased phenprocoumon dosage by 1.5 mg/week (P=0.022). Variant alleles of CYP3A41*B and ApoE showed no association with phenprocoumon dosage. Genome-wide significant SNPs were all related to VKORC1 activity. Best associated were two SNPs in complete linkage disequilibrium with each other and with SNPs within VKORC1: rs10871454 [Syntaxin 4A (STX4A)] and rs11150604 (ZNF646), each with a P value of 2.1x10-22. Each reduced phenprocoumon maintenance dosage weekly by 4.9 mg per variant allele. CONCLUSION: Similar to earlier findings with warfarin and acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon maintenance dosage depended on polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene. CYP2C9 and CYP4F2 were of modest relevance.

21094359|t|Effect of central obesity, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein polymorphisms on C-reactive protein levels during treatment with Rosuvastatin (10 mg Daily).
21094359|a|Plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are an important predictor of cardiovascular disease, and achievement of lower targets of hsCRP with rosuvastatin treatment was associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine whether hsCRP levels were related to genetic variants and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg/day. The relations were analyzed between on-treatment plasma hsCRP concentrations and cardiovascular risk factors and 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CRP and other candidate genes. In 281 patients with a median plasma hsCRP level of 0.81 mg/L (interquartile range 0.46 to 1.86), higher hsCRP levels were significantly associated with female gender, greater waist circumference (WC), having diabetes, higher triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1205, 3872G&gt;A and rs2808630, 5237A&gt;G in CRP and rs1169288, I27L in HNF1A) were independently associated with hsCRP levels before and after adjustment for other variables. WC and the CRP rs1205 polymorphism showed the strongest relations with hsCRP, and in multiple regression analysis, gender, WC, diabetes, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and the 3 genetic variants explained 35.5% of the variance in hsCRP levels. The 2 CRP polymorphisms, female gender, higher WC, and lower HDL cholesterol were associated with risk for having CRP concentrations &gt;= 1 mg/L. In conclusion, central obesity, low HDL cholesterol, and CRP polymorphisms are major determinants of higher hsCRP levels in Chinese patients receiving treatment with rosuvastatin.

21121774|t|CYP1A2 genetic polymorphisms are associated with treatment response to the antidepressant paroxetine.
21121774|a|AIM: Paroxetine is a drug of choice in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Its metabolism has recently been reported to be mediated through the CYP enzymes 1A2 and 2D6. In our current study, we tested whether genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A2 are associated with the treatment efficacy and side effects of paroxetine. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: A total of 241 MDD patients who had taken paroxetine continually for 8 weeks were recruited, and their steady state paroxetine concentrations were measured at weeks 2, 4 and 8. The genotypes of these patients were then assessed for the presence of nine SNPs, which were selected from either the HapMap Chinese ethnic group, the literature report or through their functional role in the CYP1A2 gene. RESULTS: The allele types for SNPs rs4646425 (permutation p = 0.03), rs2472304 (permutation p = 0.01) and rs2470890 (permutation p = 0.004) demonstrated significant associations with paroxetine treatment remission at week 8. Response rates in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and for The Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) were significantly associated with the SNPs rs4646425 (p = 0.0126 and 0.0088 for HAM-D and HAM-A, respectively) and rs4646427 (p = 0.0067 and 0.0196 for HAM-D and HAM-A, respectively). The inducible SNP rs762551 had a significant association with paroxetine dose at week 4 (permutation p = 0.012). We did not find an association between these SNPs and the side effects or serum concentrations of paroxetine. CONCLUSION: Genetic variants in the CYP1A2 region may be indicators of treatment response in MDD patients to paroxetine.

21159314|t|Genetic variation in BCL-2 and response to interferon in hepatitis C virus type 4 patients.
21159314|a|The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection varies across the world, with the highest number of infections reported in Egypt. BCL-2 gene polymorphism at codon 43 (127G/A) has been found to be a reliable and sensitive marker for the prediction of response to interferon therapy during viral infections. This study examined the correlation of BCL-2 gene polymorphism with the response to treatment with pegylated-IFN-alfa2b and ribavirin. Eighty patients with type 4 HCV and 40 healthy volunteers as controls were enrolled in a prospective study. Quantification of HCV-RNA by real-time PCR was performed for every patient, and gene polymorphism of BCL-2 (ala 43 Thr) was performed for all patients and controls. There was a statistically significant difference between non-responder patients and control group as regards the 43 Thr genotype and allele (P&lt;0.05). Also, there was a statistically significant difference between responders and non-responders (P&lt;0.05) as regards 43 Thr genotype and alleles. We conclude that BCL-2 gene polymorphism at codon 43 (127G/A) is a new biological marker to potentially identify responders and non-responders of HCV genotype 4 patients to achieving a sustained virological response to treatment with IFN in combination with ribavirin.

21174621|t|The effect of ESR1 and ESR2 gene polymorphisms on the outcome of rheumatoid arthritis treatment with leflunomide.
21174621|a|AIM: Leflunomide is the drug used in the therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Previous studies indicated that the efficacy of the therapy with antirheumatic drugs is more effective in men than in women. Moreover, estrogens can decrease the anti-inflammatory action of leflunomide. Estrogens act through the estrogen receptors ESR1 and ESR2. In ESR1 and ESR2 genes, several polymorphisms have been detected. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between polymorphisms in the ESR1 and ESR2 genes and the response to treatment of RA patients with leflunomide. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: The study was carried out on 115 women, mean age 54.1 +- 11.0 years, diagnosed with RA and treated with leflunomide (20 mg daily). RESULTS: Our results indicated a better response to treatment in patients with ESR1 rs9340799 AA and rs2234693 TT genotypes after 12 months of therapy. In these patients, the improvement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, patient's global assessment of disease activity on a 100 mm visual analog scale and disease activity score values was greater than in patients with other genotypes. The ESR1 rs9340799-rs2234693 A-T haplotype was associated with a better response to treatment, the G-C haplotype with a worse response and the A-C haplotype was neutral. There were no statistically significant associations of response to treatment with ESR2 gene rs4986938 and rs1256049 polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that ESR1 gene polymorphisms in females with RA may be associated with the response to treatment with leflunomide.

21228734|t|Genetic variation associated with bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy.
21228734|a|OBJECTIVE: To develop a predictive genetic signature for the development of bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN). METHODS: Two thousand and sixteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 139 samples from myeloma patients treated with bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone in the VISTA phase 3 trial. Single-marker association analysis for PN onset and time/cumulative dose to PN onset using the Cox proportional hazards model and multiple covariates was performed under additive, dominant, and recessive genotypic models, followed by correction for multiplicity. Associations were also pursued in a cohort of 212 samples from patients treated with bortezomib-dexamethasone in the IFM 2005-01 phase 3 trial. RESULTS: In the VISTA cohort, after Bonferroni correction, two SNPs significantly associated with time to onset of PN [CTLA4 rs4553808, false discovery rate (FDR)=0.002] and time to onset of grade of at least 2 PN (PSMB1 rs1474642, FDR=0.014). Using FDR less than 0.05 as the threshold, two additional SNPs significantly associated with time to onset of grade of at least 2 (CTSS rs12568757, FDR=0.027) or grade of at least 3 PN (GJE1 rs11974610, FDR=0.041). DYNC1I1 rs916758 significantly associated (FDR=0.012) with cumulative dose to onset of grade of at least 2 PN. These associations were generally not detected in the IFM 2005-01 cohort, although CTLA4 rs4553808 showed the same trend in association with time to onset (P=0.138). In addition, in the IFM 2005-01 cohort, TCF4 rs1261134 significantly associated with onset of any neurologic event (FDR=0.048). CONCLUSION: Genes associated with immune function (CTLA4, CTSS), reflexive coupling within Schwann cells (GJE1), drug binding (PSMB1), and neuron function (TCF4, DYNC1I1) associated with bortezomib-induced PN in this study.

21261619|t|Genetic variation in renin predicts the effects of thiazide diuretics.
21261619|a|BACKGROUND: While genetic variants of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may modify the blood pressure (BP) response to thiazide diuretics, there was no evidence of genetic variations in renin (REN) playing a role. This study aimed to address the potential effects of genetic variations of RAAS on the response to initial treatment of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled nondiabetic hypertensive patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;=140 or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;=90mmHg, who were either previously untreated or unsatisfactorily treated. After lifestyle modification and diet instruction for 2weeks, 90 patients with persistently elevated BP were given HCTZ 50 mg every morning for 2 weeks. Single nucleotide polymorphism markers were selected from genes involving in RAAS, including rs7079 and rs699 of angiotensinogen, rs4293 and rs4353 of angiotensin-converting enzyme and rs1464816 and rs11240688 of REN. RESULTS: The patients were divided into three groups according to the SBP response after HCTZ. The upper 1/3 responders had older age (P=0 035), higher SBP (P=0 039), higher pulse pressure (P=0 006) and lower plasma REN activity (PRA) (P=0 020) when compared with the lower 1/3 responders. Renin rs11240688 CC polymorphism (beta=9 931, corrected P=0 012), Log PRA (beta=7 451, P=0 004) and baseline SBP (beta=0 299, P=0 006) were the independent predictors for the BP lowering response. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to PRA, renin rs11240688 CC polymorphism may also independently predict the effect of HCTZ.

21269061|t|Interaction of ACE and CYP11B2 genes on blood pressure response to hydrochlorothiazide in Han Chinese hypertensive patients.
21269061|a|To valuate whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) gene -344T/C polymorphism are associated with individual response to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in the Han Chinese population with essential hypertension. We enrolled 829 mild/moderate hypertensive patients and 12.5 mg of HCTZ was given daily. After 6 weeks, the results showed that the ACE I/D polymorphism, not the CYP11B2 -344T/C polymorphism, was associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) response to HCTZ (P = 0.009) in the Han Chinese population with essential hypertension, with no interaction.

21280081|t|The COMT Val158Met polymorphism affects the response to entacapone in Parkinson's disease: a randomized crossover clinical trial.
21280081|a|OBJECTIVE: In Parkinson disease (PD), the selective C-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone prolongs the effect of levodopa on motor symptoms (ON time) by increasing its bioavailability. The COMT Val158Met polymorphism is equally distributed in PD patients and modulates COMT activity, which can be high (Val/Val, COMT(HH) ), intermediate (Val/Met, COMT(HL) ), or low (Met/Met, COMT(LL) ). The objective of this study was to determine the response to entacapone in COMT(HH) and COMT(LL) PD patients. METHODS: Thirty-three PD patients, homozygous for the COMT alleles COMT(HH) (n = 17) and COMT(LL) (n = 16), were randomized in a double-blind crossover trial consisting of 2 successive acute levodopa challenges associated with 200mg entacapone or placebo. The primary endpoint was the gain in the best ON time. Secondary endpoints were levodopa pharmacokinetics and COMT activity in red blood cells. RESULTS: The gain in the best ON time was higher in COMT(HH) than in COMT(LL) patients (39 +- 10 vs 9 +- 9 minutes, p = 0.04, interaction between treatment and genotype). Area under the concentration over time curve of levodopa increased more after entacapone in COMT(HH) than in COMT(LL) patients (+62 +- 6% vs +34 +- 8%, p = 0.01). COMT inhibition by entacapone was higher in COMT(HH) than in COMT(LL) patients (-0.54 +- 0.07 vs -0.31 +- 0.06 pmol/min/mg protein, p = 0.02). INTERPRETATION: The COMT(HH) genotype in PD patients enhances the effect of entacapone on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of levodopa. The response to entacapone after repeated administrations and in heterozygous patients remains to be determined.

21327421|t|Retrospective study of the impact of pharmacogenetic variants on paclitaxel toxicity and survival in patients with ovarian cancer.
21327421|a|PURPOSE: Paclitaxel has a broad spectrum of anti-tumor activity and is useful in the treatment of ovarian, breast, and lung cancer. Paclitaxel is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 and transported by P-glycoprotein. The dose-limiting toxicities are neuropathy and neutropenia, but the interindividual variability in toxicity and also survival is large. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of genetic variants in CYP2C8 and ABCB1 on toxicity and survival. METHODS: The 182 patients previously treated for ovarian cancer with carboplatin and paclitaxel in either the AGO-OVAR-9 or the NSGO-OC9804 trial in Denmark or Sweden were eligible for this study. Genotyping was carried out on formalin-fixed tissue. The patients' toxicity profiles and survival data were derived from retrospective data. CYP2C8*3, ABCB1 C1236T, G2677T/A, and C3435T were chosen a priori for primary analysis; a host of other variants were entered into an exploratory analysis. RESULTS: Clinical data and tissue were available from a total of 119 patients. Twenty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genes were determined. Toxicity registration was available from 710 treatment cycles. In the primary analysis, no statistically significant correlation was found between CYP2C8*3, ABCB1 C1236T, G2677T/A, and C3435T and neutropenia, sensoric neuropathy, and overall survival. CONCLUSION: CYP2C8*3 and the ABCB1 SNPs C1236T, G2677T/A, and C3435T were not statistically significantly correlated to overall survival, sensoric neuropathy, and neutropenia in 119 patients treated for ovarian cancer with paclitaxel/carboplatin.

21332319|t|Gene-gene interaction analyses between NMDA receptor subunit and dopamine receptor gene variants and clozapine response.
21332319|a|AIMS: To investigate the possible association and gene-gene interaction effects of polymorphisms in NMDA receptor subunit (GRIN1, GRIN2A and GRIN2B) and dopamine receptor (DRD1, DRD2 and DRD3) genes with clozapine response. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: GRIN1 rs11146020 (G1001C), GRIN2A GT-repeat and GRIN2B rs10193895 (G-200T) polymorphisms were tested for association in a Caucasian (n = 183) and an African-American (n = 49) sample using chi(2) and ANOVA tests. Logistic regression and two-way ANOVA were used to explore gene-gene interaction effects with dopamine receptor gene variants. RESULTS &amp; CONCLUSION: This study does not support the involvement of the NMDA receptor subunit gene polymorphisms in clozapine response. All tests for an association were negative. Gene-gene interaction analyses however yielded promising leads, including an observed effect between DRD1 rs686 and DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphisms on clozapine response (p = 0.002).

21427285|t|Effect of HMGCR variant alleles on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering response to atorvastatin in healthy Korean subjects.
21427285|a|The investigators quantified the relationship between the genetic polymorphism of HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering effects of atorvastatin in a prospective clinical study. Twenty-four healthy participants were grouped into HMGCR rs3846662 GG (n = 13) and AA (n = 11) genotypes and given atorvastatin (20 mg/d) for 14 days. Serum levels of LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and creatinine kinase (CK) were measured before (day 1) and 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, and 28 days after dosing initiation. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were taken on days 14 through 16. The levels of LDL-C in the GG group were significantly higher than in the AA group at all observation times, with mean differences of 18% to 33% (P &lt; .05). The area under the LDL-C-time curve and the minimum value of LDL-C in the GG group were 24% and 23% higher than in the AA group, respectively (P &lt; .01). There was no significant difference in other lipids, CK, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The HMGCR rs3846662 GG genotype was quantitatively documented to be a significant determinant for higher LDL-C level in basal state and possibly in response to atorvastatin.

21435719|t|Impact on response and survival of DNA repair single nucleotide polymorphisms in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients treated with thalidomide.
21435719|a|Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 genes involving multidrug resistance, drug metabolic pathways, DNA repair systems and cytokines were examined in 28 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) treated with single agent thalidomide and the results were correlated with response, toxicity and overall survival (OS). The response rate was higher in patients with SNPs in ERCC1 (rs735482) (p=0.006), ERCC5 (rs17655) (p=0.04) or XRCC5 (rs1051685) (p=0.013). Longer OS was associated with the SNP in ERCC1 (rs735482) (p=0.005) and XRCC5 (rs1051685) (p=0.02). Finally, polymorphism in GSTT1 (rs4630) was associated with a lower frequency of thalidomide-induced peripheral neuropathy (p=0.04).
